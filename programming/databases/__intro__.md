## Databases

- A database is an abstraction over operating system's file system that makes it easier for developers to build applications that create, read, update and delete data.

- Why are databases necessary? At a high level web applications store data and present it to users in a useful way. For example, Google stores data about roads and provides directions to get from one location to another by driving through the Maps application. Driving directions are possible because the data is stored in a structured format.

  Databases make structured storage reliable and fast. They also give you a mental framework for how the data should be saved and retrieved instead of having to figure out what to do with the data every time you build a new application.
  
- Most of the databases gets categorized in to two. One is relation databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL ... etc. and others are no-SQL databases such as MangoDB, Redis ... etc.
