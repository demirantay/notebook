## SQL

- Before I dive deep in `PostgreSQL` you must learn the basics with a plain SQL language. For the sake of simplicity I will use the python langauge and sqlite for this note paper.

- Databases are important because you need to store information and serve it back to the end user in high level applications. For example, Google stores data about roads and provides directions to get from one location to another by driving through the Maps application. Driving directions are possible because the data is stored in a structured format.
