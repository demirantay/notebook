# Courses & Projects For Learning Web Dev

## Practice
There aren't many project because at some point you need to maintain one big applicaiton instead of writing new clones.

- [X]  Project: Pick a template from [here](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/website-template/), [here](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates) or [here](http://www.os-templates.com/free-website-templates) and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)
- [X]  Project: Pick a template from [here](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/website-template/), [here](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates) or [here](http://www.os-templates.com/free-website-templates) and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)
