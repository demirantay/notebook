# Courses & Projects For Learning Web Dev

## Practice
There aren't many project because at some point you need to maintain one big applicaiton instead of writing new clones.

- [X]  Project: Pick a template from [here](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/website-template/), [here](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates) or [here](http://www.os-templates.com/free-website-templates) and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)

  - [ ] See Facebook for useful features that you might have missed since there a lot in facebook notifications, etc.
- [ ]  Project: Create bots to create content. In oder to do that you need to learn how to create a API for hobio
- [ ]  Project: Learn how to deal with the PaaS, IaaS host services for your projects 'hobio' in this instance.
- [ ]  Project: Keep maintaining hobio it will be never done it is your open source commitment from  now on.
- [ ]  Project: Update your Portfolio highlighting your best work.

- [ ]  Project: Create and polish your Resume/CV.
- [ ]  Project: [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview) on HackerRank
- [ ]  Project: Continue honing your skills as you interview. Participate in more bot competitions on CodinGame, participate in competitions on Kaggle, contribute to open source JavaScript or Python projects, work on side projects that illustrate your frontend skill.
- [ ]  Project: Create a package and distrubute it.
- [ ]  Project: Read up on [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - try to incorporate it into your workflow if you aren't using it regularly already
- [ ]  Project: Read up on [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - try to use it to test your JavaScript, every chance you get  
- [ ]  Project: Try to sell a frontend template code.
- [ ]  Project:  Simon Game from the frontend section of FCC   
- [ ]  Project: Design, implement, test, and deploy a game that is playable on the web, using the technologies of your choice. The only criteria are that it be playable online, and that it inculde a substantial AI component.
- [ ]  Project: Clone [Learn Harmony](http://learnharmony.org/#/?_k=0okjs7)
