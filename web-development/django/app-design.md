# Fundementals Of Django App Design

## Using Apps

While coding a django project always try to create apps for specific tasks never try to create a one gigantic app that contains all the logic of the project. For example while building a twitter dont ever create just one single `twitter_app` and dump all of your code init. 

Instead try to break down the app and remember the golden rule of app design `if you cant explain it in one sentence you should create an app` . So you would have an app for , profiles, home feed, analytics, search, blog ... etc.
