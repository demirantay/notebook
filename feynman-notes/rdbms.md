## Relational Database Management System's

> Not complete

As we discussed databases in a perivious feynman note we have to understand that over time the smart programmers developed a lot of ways to store and manipulate data. But essentialy we can boil them down to SQL which is relational database systems and NoSQL systems. There cannot be a census stating that one of the approach is better than the other however they have their weaknesses and strengths.

Relational database managemnt systems are very powerful when you know that your data will be structured and want to be secure, ACID, ..etc. It is a lot easier to use RDMBS systems. The programmer can use `SQL` (Structured Query Language) which is as it can be understood from its name a programming language designed for querying and manipulating data in a structured format.

Not all RDBMS systems such as postgresql or sqlite support the same functionality and usabilty for sql queries and they have their own commands. Most important key in these db systems is the `keys` for connection one table to another

This is not a good note at all I will edit this later on when I undertand  a lot more ...
