## API's

An api is a interface for the program itself. We know what a interface is it is the very thing we use in order to talkor use the product. Well it is the same with programs itself if they want to use another programs they need to use a interface. Yet, since they are simply code and not humans they cannot simply touch a button view it on a secreen and use its `user interface`. Thats why programmers before us created a `application programming interface` for enabling their code to talk to other code. 

They are sometimes referred to as *"the glue between software"* . For example a piece of software has the data of all the weather all around the world and your software is a weather application for android, you can simply connect your app to the weather data providing software and use its data without having to hire methadorologist.
