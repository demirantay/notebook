## Computer Languages

We need languages to comminucate to each other as human beings. It is nearly the same with the computers, we need a commucation line between the human and the machine and right now we use programming languages. These can range from low level langauges to high level langauges. What is the difference between the high and low ? the higher level languages are abstracted in many ways and you do not have to worry a lot about how the language communicates with the machine using its inner architecture. 

The concept of programming languages is very similar to normal languages they have dialects from a single language have their family and their own way of speaking and puting their grammar together. And as it is the same in the normal life the computer languages we speak limit how we think and don't think. 

But there is a catch the computers do not understand the computer languages. No, they are not as smart as we are and they only understand binary which is 0s and 1s. You can think of it as true, false or on and off this is one of the fundemental basis of boolean algebra and its truth tables but it is another topic to talk about. This 0s and 1s are called machine code. There is a program that converts the things we type in a comoputer language to 0s and 1s. I will talk about compilers in another feyman note.

Will simplify the notes later on ...
