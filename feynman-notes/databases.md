## Databases 

> Not Complete

We need a abstracted file storage systems that needs to sit on top of the operating systems file storage system. Because we cannot go all around the world and check every computer if they have the same data or use a freaking spread sheet to keep our records. We can simply store them in a centralized place with a nice layout and easy to create, update, read and delete with a secure connection. It is simply more convenient to use them. 

In short why use json or some bad idea of storing data on your disk when you can simply deepnd on the databases which are fast, scalable, secure and able to query (talk/manipulate) your data. But I am very new to databases so I will add more notes later.

I will simplfy and add more when I understand more ...
