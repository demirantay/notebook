## Testing

Testing is not really hard to understand. We only test our code because we want to be sure it is working. It is as simple as that. They may throw you words like TDD (Test Drive Development) and all those fancy english but again in the end you are just testing the new code before you implement it on to your existing code base to make sure nothing gets broken. 

It is very important to write tests to make sure you are developing a good software and you should only test your own code. If you downloaded someone elses code from a packaage manager that code is already tested before it reaches to your use if it is not tested do not use that risky code. Your tests should be like your documentation, it should be readable from top the bottom. And remember most of the people will not treat your software with good regard unless it is tested.
