Git is a version control system. But what does that fancy words mean ? It's a simple tool that lets you "capture" the code at a certian point of your desire and then lets you accsess that captured moment (version) of your code whenever you want. It is very useful since it is so easy to break your code and forget about what you coded on the next day at work. You can simply roll your code back to a version that works perfectly and voila nothing is broken anymore. Sure you will lose progress if you do it but it is a very cheap price to pay for not messing up your all codebase for ever.

And there are a lot of cool things come with git too. Forexample github, gitlab and such websites are built on top of git. So you can always store your projects on these sites and accsess them using git(pull, push) from whatever machine you are using it is a very simple and a killer tool to learn.

I will simplify when I learn more ...
