## Package Manager's

> Not Complete

While we write code, we can simply store them in a centralized place for other people or future us to retrieve it and re use it. In the old times it used to be done via downloading the necessary code from various kind of links, places, cd's. However in 2018 you can use `pacakage managers` which are basically the tool that lets us retrieve other peoples code to use it in our code. 

The code we retrieve is usually files of functions and classes. Even though you call your files of code `Framework` or some other sexy english word it is essentially just bunch of functions or classes written in order to remove DRY code for future programmers.

Not all programming languages support a package management system even though it exists for most of the higher level langauges, the ones that are close to the system and are not cross platform c/c++ languages use different compilers for different platforms. I am not very sure about this topic I will edit it later.

I will simplfy more when I understand more ...
