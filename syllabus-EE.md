This roadmap is not in its final form. It hasnt even started properly yet.

### Theory 

- [ ] __MOST IMPRTANT THING BEFORE STARTING GET HELP FROM REAL ENGINEERS TO CREATE A ROADMAP FOR YOU__
- [ ] Math -- Learn it a lot (khan academy, other resources )
- [ ] Physics - starter:  Electric charge, field, and potential / Circuits / Work and energy /  Magnetic forces, magnetic fields, and Faraday's law / Electromagnetic waves and interference
- [ ] Physics -- Learn it a lot (khan academy, other resources)
- [ ] Chemistry -- Learn it a lot (khan academy, other resources)
- [ ] Biology -- Learn it a lot (khan academy, other resources)
- [ ] Book: Electronic Circuits: Handbook for Design Applications
- [ ] The Art of Electronics by Horowitz & Hill.
- [ ] ...

### Practical

- [ ] Write a basic 8 bit computer
