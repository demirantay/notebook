# Physics

I am not going to note down the depths of every phyics topic in the universe, however I will keep the formlas, explanations I like in this folder.

- There will be times where you will just learn about "Formulas" and stuff like that but remember a formula is just a toolkit for you to make you understand the idea that you are trying to understand. We could have used plain english instead of a symploic gibberish looking formulas but as it is mentioned above the formulas are just a toolkit for you to understand more, they do not matter. The only thing that matters is the idea you are trying to grasp.

- It is impossible to define what physics is. Yes, as humankind we discover new theories but those discovieries also create new questions to be answered. Modifies our past understandings or discredit them fully. This nature of physics make ist impossible to defined or understand with a basic human brain. But if we must, we can give a definition to the "humans interaction to the physics as":
  - Humans try to precisely define the msot fundemental measurable quantities in the universe. (e.g. velocity, electric field, kinetic energy ... etc.) The quest to understand the fundementals of the universe we live in has has been tried to conquered by many great thinkers thorughout the history of the human kind. But in the end we humans try to describe the complex universe around us with simple, clear and useful laws.
