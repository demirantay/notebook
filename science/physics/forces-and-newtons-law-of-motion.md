# Newtons Laws of Moiton

- Lets first examine what is the first law is about:

### First Law:

- Before Galileo and Newton, many people thought objects slowed down because they had a natural built in tendency to do so. But those people weren't taking into account the many forces—e.g., friction, gravity, and air resistance—here on Earth that cause objects to change their velocity.

  If we could observe the motion of an object in deep interstellar space, we would be able to observe the natural tendencies of an object's motion free from any external influences. In deep interstellar space, we would observe that if an object had a velocity, it would continue moving with that velocity until there was some force to cause a change in the motion. Similarly, if an object were at rest in interstellar space, it would remain at rest until there was a force to cause it to change its motio
  
  The idea that objects only change their velocity due to a force is encapsulated in Newton's `first law`
  
- The real wrapped-up definition of the law would be: An object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.

- `What do force, external force, and net force mean?`:
  - A force is a push or a pull exerted on one object by another object. The units of force `F` are called Newtons or simply `N`.
  
    An external force is a force originating from outside an object rather than a force internal to an object. For instance, the force of gravity that Earth exerts on the moon is an external force on the moon. However, the force of gravity that the inner core of the moon exerts on the outer crust of the moon is an internal force on the moon
    
    The net force, written as `ΣF`, on an object is the total force on an object. If many forces act on an object, then the net force is the sum of all the forces. But be careful—since force `F` is a vector, to find the net force `ΣF`, the forces must be added up like vectors using vector addition.
    
    In other words, if a box of frozen burritos had a force of magnitude 45 Newtons exerted on it to the right and a force of magnitude 30 Newtons exerted on it to the left, the net force in the horizontal direction would be: `ΣF = 45N - 30N` 

- `What does mass mean?`:
  - The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia. Newton’s first law is often called the law of `inertia`. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for example.
  
    The inertia of an object is measured by its mass. Mass can be determined by measuring how difficult an object is to accelerate. The more mass an object has, the harder it is to accelerate. Also, roughly speaking, the more “stuff”—or matter—in something, the more mass it will have, and the harder it will be to change its velocity, i.e., accelerate.
    
### Second Law:

- In the world of introductory physics, Newton's second law is one of the most important laws you'll learn. It's used in almost every chapter of every physics textbook, so it's important to master this law as soon as possible.

  We know objects can only accelerate if there are forces on the object. Newton's second law tells us exactly how much an object will accelerate for a given net force: `a = ΣF / m` (To be clear, aaa is the acceleration of the object, `ΣF` is the net force on the object, and mmm is the mass of the object.) But people usually write newtons second law in this form: 
  `F = m * a`
  
- `What does net force mean`: A force is a push or a pull, and the net force `ΣF` is the total force—or sum of the forces—exerted on an object. Adding vectors is a little different from adding regular numbers. When adding vectors, we must take their direction into account. For instance, consider the two forces of magnitude 30 N and 20 N that are exerted to the right and left respectively on the sheep :

  ΣF=30 N−20 N<br>
  ΣF=10 N to the right
