# Introduction to the Atom

- Just by looking around us there are different subtances and different subtances tend to have different properties (color, light, solid or liquid ... etc.)
  
  Just to get our terminology in order, we call these different subtances, these pure subtances that have different properties at certain temperatures `elements` e.g. carbon, led, gold, oxygen, hydrogen. and you can find all of the elements listed in the periodic table. 
  
- And that most basic unit of any of these elements is the atom. For example if you get the smallest piece of an element, you would get an atom. E.g. carbon atom, gold atom ... etc.

- Every atom has fundemental particles and if you actually change those fundemental particles you could transform one element o another because everything in the universe is actually connected but that is a different topic for another time. 

  Lets talk about those fundemental elements:
    - `Proton`: the numbers of protons in the nucleus of an atom, that is what defines the element + when you look at the periodic table they are actually written in order of atomic number and the atomic number is literally just the number of protons.
