# One Dimensional Motion

- Notes on one dimensional motion. For the time being I just studied from khan academy.

## Displacement, Velocity and Time

- First before we dive into One dimensional motions lets define what vectors, scalars, velocity and speed are:
  - `Vectors` - must have a magnitude(size) and a directrion
  - `Scalars` - must only have magnitude(size)
  - `Velocity` - if you want o know how fast the directing object is going you are talking bout velocity
  - `Speed` - if you don't specify a direction and want to know how fast the object is you are talking bout speed
  
  For example if we *moved an object(box, car ... etc.) 5 meters to the left* This would be `vectoral` because it has a magnitude `5m` and a direction to the `left`. If we moved it just 5meters and thats it, it would be `scalar`

- In phyics one of the most important topic is to how to describe a "motion" since it is so important to everything we do in physics. But to describe an objects motion, we have to first be able to descrive an objects position-where it is at a particular time, more precisely we need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Eath is often used as a reference frame. 

  Just like in math physics use `x` for horizontal representation and `y` for vertical representation of an object in a spcae. 
  
### What does Displacement mean ?

- If an object moves relative to a reference frame—for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a whiteboard, or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane—then the object’s position changes. This change in position is known as displacement. The word displacement implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced.

  `Displacement`: is defined to be the change in position of an object. It can be defined mathematically with the following equation:
