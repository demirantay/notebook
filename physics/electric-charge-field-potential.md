### Tribo Electric Effect and Charge

- I'm guessing that you-ve had the experience of rubbing a baloon against your hair and then when you take the baloon away from your hair, your hair sticks up.

  What you just experienced after you rubbed the balloon on your head, and and then your hair is now attracted to the baloon, thats actually called the `triboelectric effect`.
  
  Human beings have observed that some of the objects might discharge when it touches another object. and scientists have been trying to come up with a framework for what exactly is happening. Luckily we now have the framework and it explains what is going on quite well. 
  
- The framework bascailly says llok, there's some things that just have a property called charge. Some things have a positive charge and some things have what we say is an opposite charge or a negative charge.

  and so if we say something has a charge say a positive charge and something else has a negative charge, then in our framework these two things are going to attract. So oppsite charges attract each other while like charges repel each other.
  
  And if you go down to the atomic level, we can get to a fundemental level of where the charge is happening. But once again, these are really models for our brain to describe, these are framework and models for our brain to be able to predict and describe what we observe in the world. 
  
- So what happens when you rub your hair to the ballon, that the balloon is attracting the electrons from your hair so in the basic sense you can esaily sum the process into "a transfer of electrons"

- The elementary unit of charge is denoted by the letter `e`. And in general if we are not talking on a atomic level and look from a broader perspective the unit of charge we typically use is the coulomb (named after the french scientis).

- But at some levels it is this thing one of the mysteries of the universe, how did these two particles know to attract each other, How do they immediately know to repel eac other its not like they have a wire connecting them . But they are communucatiing somehow. On the one level of engineering it is mundane but from a physics perspective charge is still a mystery to be discovered fully.
