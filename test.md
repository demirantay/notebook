# Syllabus

The syllabus of my self teaching computer science journey divides into three: studying; practicing what I have learnt; learning skills that are needed in current job market.

## Computer Science Guide

Try to make at least something in each section and since sections put on top of one another do not move to the other section without learning the perivious one fully.

### Programming

Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion

 - [ ] Course : [Helsinki MOOC's](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/material.html) for the desired language.
 - [ ] Book : [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf). Just read the first 3 chapters.
 - [ ] Videos : [Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)
  
### Computer Architecture
  
  If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.
  
  - [ ] Course : [Nand2Tetris Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
  - [ ] Course : [Nand2Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)
  - [ ] Book : [Computer Organization and Design](http://mprc.pku.edu.cn/courses/organization/autumn2012/COD.pdf). Not every section is essential.
  - [ ] Course : [CS61C course](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/) past lecture [videos](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-cvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_) are here
  
  ### Algorithms & Data Structures
  
  If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve hard problems.
  
  - [ ] Book: [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/?pldnSite=1) There are [vidoes](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/) avilable too.
  - [ ] Course: [Stanford MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
  - [ ] Exercise : [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - solve around 100 problems.
  - [ ] Book : [How to solve it](https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069116407X/?pldnSite=1)
  
### Mathematics for Computer Science
  
  CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.
  
  - [ ] Study : Most important math for CS is discrete math. Finish the prerequisites from khan academy.
  - [ ] Course : [Important dicrete course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/)
  - [ ] Read : [Lecture notes for Discrete Mathematics](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/dmbook.ps)
  - [ ] Course : [Mathemtaics for Computer Scinece](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm)
   - [ ] Course: [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
   - [ ] Course : [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/)
   
 ### Operating Systems
   
   Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.
   
   - [ ] Book : [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
   - [ ] Project : Code a small OS kernel
   
 ### Computer Networking
   
   The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.
   
   - [ ] Book : [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149/?pldnSite=1) -- do the exersices
   - [ ] Exersices : [Wireshark](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/)
   - [ ] Course : [Stanford MOOC](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Networking-SP/SelfPaced/about)
   - [ ] Project : Your own small internet, HTTP server or etc. dont forget to practice what you learn.
   
 ### Databases
   
   Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.
   
   - [ ] Course : [Berkley Course](https://archive.org/details/UCBerkeley_Course_Computer_Science_186)
   - [ ] Paper : [Database Architecture](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf)
   - [ ] Book : [Red Book](http://www.redbook.io/) -- your next stop after berkley course
   - [ ] Project idea: Write a simple relational database management system from scratch.
   
   ### Languages and Compilers
   
   If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily
   
   - [ ] Course : [Stanford Course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about) read the [dragon book](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811?pldnSite=1) on the units of stanford do not read all the book.
   - [ ] Project : Create a basic compiler for a learning langauge or a simple language you have created.
   
 ### Distributed Systems
   
   These days, most systems are distributed systems.
   
   - [ ] Book : [Distibuted Systems, 3rd edition](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/distributed-systems-3rd-edition-2017/)
