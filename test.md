# Syllabus

The syllabus of my self teaching computer science journey divides into three: studying; practicing what I have learnt; learning skills that are needed in current job market.

## Study Guide

Try to make at least something in each section and since sections put on top of one another do not move to the other section without learning the perivious one fully.

### Programming

Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion

 - [ ] Course : [Helsinki MOOC's](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/material.html) for the desired language.
 - [ ] Book : [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf). Just read the first 3 chapters.
 - [ ] Videos : [Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)
  
  ### Computer Architecture
  
  If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.
  
  - [ ] Course : [Nand2Tetris Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
  - [ ] Course : [Nand2Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)
  - [ ] Book : [Computer Organization and Design](). Not every section is essential.
  - [ ] Course : [CS61C course](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/) past lecture [videos](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-cvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_) are here
