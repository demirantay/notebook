# Creating Interpreters

> My notes of the e-book: https://craftinginterpreters.com

- Before we strap on our hiking boots and venture out, we should familiarize ourselves with the territory. The chapters in this part introduce you to the basic concepts used by programming languages and how they are organized.

  We will also get acquainted with Lox, the language we’ll spend the rest of the book implementing (twice). Let’s go!
