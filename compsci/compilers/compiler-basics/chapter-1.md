# About this paper

- This paper is intended to give an overview of basic compiler theory. It is not intended to be complete by any means. It certainly will not replace a college level compiler course, however, it will provide a good solid foundation on which such a course can build.

- This paper does not develop a full compiler, but small examples are given in many places. Where possible, examples are given in Pascal; that is the code being parsed is Pascal and the code performing the parsing is also Pascal. This language is simple and elegant. Where C is more powerful, Pascal is more readable

- Object Oriented Programming is not covered in detail, however there is a section given on parsing objects. It seems that C++ has become the standard object oriented language, but because of its heritage it is a convoluted language that is difficult to understand. So instead of using C++ for the examples the language Language for Object Oriented Programming (LOOP) will be used. This is a language I am working on, that is intended to be a beginners' object oriented language.
