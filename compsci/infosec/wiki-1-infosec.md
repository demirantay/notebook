# Wiki Summary :: Information Security

- Information security, sometimes shortened to infosec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks.  It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion/destruction, corruption, modification, inspection, recording or devaluation, although it may also involve reducing the adverse impacts of incidents.

- nformation security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.[2] This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves:
  - Identifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities and impacts;
  - Evaluating the risks;
  - Deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them;
  - Where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them;
  - Monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunities.

# Overview

- At the core of information security is information assurance, the act of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of information, ensuring that information is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise.

### Threats

- Information security threats come in many different forms. Some of the most common threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses,[9] worms, phishing attacks and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks.

  There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is conduct periodical user awareness. The number one threat to any organisation are users or internal employees, they are also called insider threats.

### Responses to threats

- Possible responses to a security threat or risk are:
  - reduce/mitigate – implement safeguards and countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats
  - assign/transfer – place the cost of the threat onto another entity or organization such as purchasing insurance or outsourcing
  - accept – evaluate if the cost of the countermeasure outweighs the possible cost of loss due to the threat

# Key Concepts

- The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.[27] (The members of the classic InfoSec triad—confidentiality, integrity and availability—are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes, properties, security goals, fundamental aspects, information criteria, critical information characteristics and basic building blocks.) However, debate continues about whether or not this CIA triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements

### Confidentiality

- In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."[35] While similar to "privacy," the two words aren't interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals

### Integrity

- In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. 

### Availabilty

- For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.

  In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization's stakeholders expect
