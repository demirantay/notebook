# Wiki Summary :: Information Security

- Information security, sometimes shortened to infosec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks.  It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion/destruction, corruption, modification, inspection, recording or devaluation, although it may also involve reducing the adverse impacts of incidents.

- nformation security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.[2] This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves:
  - Identifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities and impacts;
  - Evaluating the risks;
  - Deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them;
  - Where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them;
  - Monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunities.
