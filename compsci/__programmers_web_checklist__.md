# The technical details a programmer of a web application should consider before making the site public

> What things should a programmer implementing the technical details of a web application consider before making the site public? If Jeff Atwood can forget about HttpOnly cookies, sitemaps, and cross-site request forgeries all in the same site, what important thing could I be forgetting as well?

## Interface and User Experience

- Be aware that browsers implement standards inconsistently and make sure your site works reasonably well across all major browsers. At a minimum test against a recent [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28layout_engine%29) engine ([Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com)), a WebKit engine ([Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) and some mobile browsers), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), your supported IE browsers (take advantage of the Application Compatibility VPC Images), and Opera. Also consider how browsers [render your site in different operating systems](http://browsershots.org/).
