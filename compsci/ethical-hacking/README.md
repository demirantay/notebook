# Ethical Hacking

- Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exist in a computer system or a computer network and finally entering into them. Hacking is usually done to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the systems or to steal sensitive information available on the computer.

  Hacking is usually legal as long as it is being done to find weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call Ethical Hacking.
  
- We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here is a set of examples −
  - `Website Hacking` − Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces.
  - `Network Hacking` − Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.
  - `Email Hacking` − It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.
  - `Ethical Hacking` − Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.
  - `Password Hacking` − This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
  - `Computer Hacking` − This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system.
  
- Hacking is quite useful in the following scenarios −
  - To recover lost information, especially in case you lost your password.
  - To perform penetration testing to strengthen computer and network security.
  - To put adequate preventative measures in place to prevent security breaches.
  - To have a computer system that prevents malicious hackers from gaining access.
  
- Hacking is quite dangerous if it is done with harmful intent. It can cause −
  - Massive security breach.
  - Privacy violation.
  - Unauthorized system access on private information.
  - ... and other things

# Hacker Types

- Hackers can be classified into different categories such as white hat, black hat, and grey hat, based on their intent of hacking a system. These different terms come from old Spaghetti Westerns, where the bad guy wears a black cowboy hat and the good guy wears a white hat.
