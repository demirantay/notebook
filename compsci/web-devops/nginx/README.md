# Nginx

- Nginx, pronounced "engine X", is a fast and lightweight web server, that can be used to serve static files, but is often used as a reverse proxy. It has some very nice features like load balancing and rate limiting. We'll cover some common use cases like serving files, creating a directory listing, reverse proxying to pass incoming traffic to a local web server, adding SSL encryption, and how to require https and www on your site. This guide is for someone who needs a quick reference to setting up a simple nginx server. For the latest documentation always check out the official website https://www.nginx.com/ and the source mirror at https://github.com/nginx/nginx.

### Why use nginx?

- Use nginx if you need to reverse proxy, load balance, and rate limit network services. Reverse proxying useful if you have multiple web services listening on various ports and you need a single public endpoint to reroute requests internally.

  By setting up nginx to listen on port 80 and 443, you can set up your other web services on low-privilege ports that listen locally only. Nginx can handle the logging, load balancing, blacklisting, and serving static files while the web services focus on what they need to do.

# Installing Nginx

### Building from the Source

- If possible, this is a great option to get the latest version. Linux distribution package managers often lag behind and don't have the latest version

  The first step is to download and extract the nginx source zip or tar.gz. Find a release from the read-only GitHub repo (https://github.com/nginx/nginx/releases) or the upstream Nginx.org Mercurial repo. Find the latest release tag, like http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/rev/release-1.15.5.
  ```bash 
  # Download & extract
  wget https://github.com/nginx/nginx/archive/release-1.15.5.tar.gz
  tar xzfv release-1.15.5.tar.gz
  cd nginx-release-1.15.5
  
  # Build
  sudo apt-get install build-essential # If you need gcc and make
  auto/configure
  make
  ```
    - Executable in objs/
    - Executable file: objs/nginx
    - Sample configs in conf/
    - Default config: conf/nginx.conf
    
  To run nginx after building it from source, you'll want to create a directory for nginx to use as it's working directory. This is where temporary directories will be created, log files will be stored relative to this location, config files will be relative to here.
  ```bash
  # Create a workspace (prefix) for nginx
  mkdir /path/to/nginx_workspace
  mkdir /path/to/nginx_workspace/logs
  vim /path/to/nginx_workspace/my.conf
  ```
  To start and stop nginx use -s flag with a "stop" or "start" command.
  ```bash
  # Start nginx
  # -p is the workspace directory
  # -c is the config file
  ./nginx -p /home/dano/nginx_workspace -c my.conf

  # Stop nginx with `-s stop` flag
  # Must specify the prefix/workspace dir so it knows
  # which nginx instance to start/stop
  ./nginx -p /home/dano/nginx_workspace -c my.conf -s stop
  ```

### Ubuntu 

- The easiest way to get nginx on Ubuntu is to install using apt-get.
  ```bash
  # See what version is available in the repos
  apt-cache show nginx

  # Install with apt-get package manager
  sudo apt-get install nginx

  # It will be started by default. Control it with:
  sudo systemctl stop nginx
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl restart nginx

  # View logs with:
  journalctl -u nginx

  # Get the status with:
  sudo systemctl status nginx
  ```
  Important locations:
  - Base config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  - Default config: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  - Logs will be in /var/log/nginx/
  - Custom configs will go in /etc/nginx/conf.d/ or /etc/nginx/sites-available and then symlinked to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
  - Default webroot: /var/www/html

### Fedora

- The easiest way to get nginx on Fedora is to install using dnf.
  ```bash
  # Install with dnf package manager
  sudo dnf install nginx

  # Control it with:
  sudo systemctl stop nginx
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl restart nginx

  # View logs with:
  journalctl -u nginx

  # Get the status with:
  sudo systemctl status nginx
  ```
  Important locations:
  - Base config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  - Directory for custom configs: /etc/nginx/conf.d/
  - Logs directory: /var/log/nginx/
  - Default webroot: /usr/share/nginx/html/

### Mac

- On a Mac computer, use Homebrew or follow the build nginx from source instructions.
  ```bash
  # Install with Homebrew
  brew install nginx

  # Start and stop nginx, sudo needed for low number ports
  nginx  
  nginx -s stop

  # or control it using brew services
  brew services start nginx
  brew services stop nginx
  ```
  Important locations:
  - Default listen address: http://localhost:8080
  - Default web root: /usr/local/var/www/
  - Default config file: /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  - Add custom configs in: /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/
  - Logs will be in in: /usr/local/var/log/nginx/

# Beginners Guide 

- This guide describes how to start and stop nginx, and reload its configuration, explains the structure of the configuration file and describes how to set up nginx to serve out static content, how to configure nginx as a proxy server, and how to connect it with a FastCGI application

  nginx has one master process and several worker processes. The main purpose of the master process is to read and evaluate configuration, and maintain worker processes. Worker processes do actual processing of requests. nginx employs event-based model and OS-dependent mechanisms to efficiently distribute requests among worker processes.
  
  The number of worker processes is defined in the configuration file and may be fixed for a given configuration or automatically adjusted to the number of available CPU cores 
  
  The way nginx and its modules work is determined in the configuration file. By default, the configuration file is named `nginx.conf`

### Starting, Stopping, and Reloading Configuration

- To start nginx, run the executable file. Once nginx is started, it can be controlled by invoking the executable with the -s parameter. Use the following syntax:
  ```
  nginx -s signal
  ```
  Where signal may be one of the following:
  - `$ nginx` --  start the web server
  - `$ nginx -s stop` -- fast shutdown
  - `$ nginx -s quit` -- graceful shutdown
  - `$ nginx -s reload` -- reloading the configuration file
  - `$ nginx -s reopen` -- reopening the log files
  
  For example Changes made in the configuration file will not be applied until the command to `reload` configuration is sent to nginx or it is restarted. 
  ```
  nginx -s reload
  ```
  Once the master process receives the signal to reload configuration, it checks the syntax validity of the new configuration file and tries to apply the configuration provided in it. If this is a success, the master process starts new worker processes and sends messages to old worker processes, requesting them to shut down. Otherwise, the master process rolls back the changes and continues to work with the old configuration.
  
- A signal may also be sent to nginx processes with the help of Unix tools such as the kill utility. In this case a signal is sent directly to a process with a given process ID
  ```
  kill -s QUIT 1628
  ```
  For getting the list of all running nginx processes, the ps utility may be used, for example, in the following way:
  ```
  ps -ax | grep nginx
  ```

### Configuration Fileâ€™s Structure

- nginx consists of modules which are controlled by directives specified in the configuration file. Directives are divided into simple directives and block directives. A simple directive consists of the name and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;). A block directive has the same structure as a simple directive, but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional instructions surrounded by braces ({ and }). If a block directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a context (examples: events, http, server, and location).
