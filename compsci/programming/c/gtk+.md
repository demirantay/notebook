## GTK+

- GTK+ is a graphical user interface that is built originally for C/C++ if you are so keen on using other lagnauges you canuse python and perl too. GTK is also called the GIMPTool kit

- Before we dive into the realm of GTK+ we need to learn how to compile our GTK+ programs lets examine:
  ```bash
  $ gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0`
  ```
  This line compiles a basic program. The source code consists of one file - foo.c
  
  The --cflags parameter prints pre-processor and compile flags required to compile GTK+ programs, including flags for all their dependencies. The --libs parameter lists the necessary libraries.
