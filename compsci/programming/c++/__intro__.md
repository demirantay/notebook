# C++

- C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.

- C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

- C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

- Standard C++ consists of three important parts âˆ’
  - The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.
  - The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.
  - The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.
  
- The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you write for Microsoft's compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a Mac, UNIX, a Windows box, or an Alpha. The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compiler manufacturers support the ANSI standard.

## Basic Sytax

- First, lets write the notorious Hello, World program:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namepsace std;
  
  int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0
  }
  ```
  In order to compile and run this program firstly we need to save this into a file and give it a `.cpp` extension at the end. after that you can either use `gcc` compiler or `make` to compile your source code (just like in C)
  ```
  $ gcc foo.cpp 
  ```
  Which will give you a `a.out` file and you can run it with `./a.out` or you can use the `make` and run it with the files name.
  
- Comments are like in javascript etiher with `// ...` or `/* ... */
