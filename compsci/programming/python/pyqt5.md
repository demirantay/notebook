# PyQt5

- PyQt5 is a GUI widgets toolkit. It is a Python interface for Qt, one of the most powerful, and popular cross-platform GUI library. PyQt was developed by RiverBank Computing Ltd. The latest version of PyQt can be downloaded from its official website âˆ’ riverbankcomputing.com
  
  Or if you know the version you want you can use PyPi:
  ```

  ```
  
- PyQt5 is implemented as a set of Python modules. It has over 620 classes and 6000 functions and methods. yQt5's classes are divided into several modules, including the following:
  - `QtCore` - this module contains the core non-GUI functionality. This module is used for working with time, files and directories, various data types, streams, URLs, mime types, threads or processes
  - `QtGui` - this module contains classes for windowing system integration, event handling, 2D graphics, basic imaging, fonts and text
  - `QtWidgets` - this module contains classes that provide a set of UI elements to create classic desktop-style user interfaces
  - `QtMultimedia` - this module contains classes to handle multimedia content and APIs to access camera and radio functionality.
  - `QtBluetooth` - module contains classes to scan for devices and connect and interact with them. 
  - `QtNetwork` - module contains the classes for network programming. These classes facilitate the coding of TCP/IP and UDP clients and servers by making the network programming easier and more portable.
  - `QtPositioning` - contains classes to determine a position by using a variety of possible sources, including satellite, Wi-Fi, or a text file
  - `Enginio` - module implements the client-side library for accessing the Qt Cloud Services Managed Application Runtime
  - `QtWebSockets` - module contains classes that implement the WebSocket protocol
  - `QtWebKit` - contains classes for a web browser implementation based on the WebKit2 library.
  - `QtWebKitWidgets` - contains classes for a WebKit1 based implementation of a web browser for use in QtWidgets based applications.
  - `QtXml` - contains classes for working with XML files. This module provides implementation for both SAX and DOM APIs.
  - `QtSvg` - module provides classes for displaying the contents of SVG files. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics and graphical applications in XML.
  - `QtSql` - module provides classes for working with databases
  - `QtTest` - contains functions that enable unit testing of PyQt5 applications.
