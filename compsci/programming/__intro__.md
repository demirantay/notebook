# Programming

- First lets see what wikipedia has to say about programming : 
  > Computer programming is the process of desinging and building and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computer task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating alogirthms, profiling algorithms, accuarcy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming languages (commonly reffered to as coding). The source code of the program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a problem.
  
  
- This is a fairly good summarazation of programming and to clear out from the begining software engineering is not the same as programming. In software engineering you have a lot of responsibilities such as testing, debugging, maintaining the source code. But in programming as stated above it is just a better and sequenced way of doing things it doesnt have to be realted to coding or computers you can program your daily schedule and so on ... However I am trying to become a software engineer so my notes will be related to "computer programs"

- Whatever the approach to development may be, the final computer program must satisfy some fundemental properties. The following properties are the **most** important ones.
  - `Reliability`: how often the results of a program are correct. This can depend on the correctness of the algorithms or the minimalisation of the sourse code and so on ...
  -  `Robustness`: How well the program aniticipates problems due to error (not bugs!), such as power outages, incorrect data and so on ...
  - `Usability`: the ergonomics of a program what I mean by that is the ease with which which a person can use the program for its intended purpose.
  - `Portability`: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code can run without any problems.
  - `Maintainability`: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers.
  - `Efficiency`: performance of the program the "more things you can do with less" is always the best 
  - `Readability`: even though this might be open to discussion I feel that it is *very* important that the code (program) you write should be easily readable not for other people neccessarily, but for you. It is a shame if you cannot read the code you have written the night before.
  
- There are many more things to talk about but I think this is enough for the introduction since I will note a lot of things from the notorious "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" book. I will try to add as much different notes as I can but most of this note page will consists a summary of SICP for me.
