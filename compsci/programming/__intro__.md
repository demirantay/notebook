# Programming

- First lets see what wikipedia has to say about programming : 
  > Computer programming is the process of desinging and building and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computer task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating alogirthms, profiling algorithms, accuarcy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming languages (commonly reffered to as coding). The source code of the program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a problem.
  
  
- This is a fairly good summarazation of programming and to clear out from the begining software engineering is not the same as programming. In software engineering you have a lot of responsibilities such as testing, debugging, maintaining the source code. But in programming as stated above it is just a better and sequenced way of doing things it doesnt have to be realted to coding or computers you can program your daily schedule and so on ... However I am trying to become a software engineer so my notes will be related to "computer programs"
