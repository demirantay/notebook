# CSS

- I already know most of the CSS so I am not going to note down every bit of detail like I usually do. If you want more information check out the docs: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp 

- CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

- You can write a basic css code for an html element like this:
  ```css
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
  ```
  You can get all of the elementss with : `* {...}` asteristk instead of an html tag
  
- Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular element. You can do this:
  ```css
  ul li {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

- Instead of typing every html tag in your style file, you can define a `class` or an `id` that can be modified once and used on whatever html tag you want:
  ```css
  .className {
    color: red;
  }
  
  #idName {
    color: yellow;
  }
  ```
  classes start with `.` and Id's start with `#`. Ids should represent sepficic objects while classes are for "one time styling and many time using"
  
- You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors with a comma, as given in the following example âˆ’
  ```css
  h1, h2, h3 {
   color: #36C;
   font-weight: normal;
  }
  ```
  
- As we talked erlier you can either write your css inside the `<element style="...">` attributes or inside the tags `<style></style>` or as like every other sensible developer outthere you use the `<link>` to link your html document to style sheets

# CSS Measurement Units

- These are the following measurment units in css with their example usage:
  - `%` - div { height: 100% }
  - `cm` - div {margin-bottom: 2cm }
  - `em` - div {height: 10em}
  - `ex` - p {line-height: 3ex}
  - `in` - div {height: 10in}
  - `mm` - div{ height: 10mm}
  - `pc` - p {font-size: 5pc}
  - `px` - p {font-size 15px}

  }
  ```
  
### Cursors

- I am not gonna note down cursors since there are too many of them however the basic logic is that when you hover a link, button ...etc. your mouse icon will turn into a cursor of your choosing like a hand, loading icon ... etc.
  
### Dimension

- Lets see how to set dimensions and measurements of a box (div, span, img ...etc.):
  - `height` - property is used to set the height of a box.

  - `line-height` - property is used to set the height of a line of text.
  - `max-height` - property is used to set a maximum height that a box can be.
  - `min-height` - property is used to set the minimum height that a box can be
  - `max-width` - property is used to set the maximum width that a box can be
  - `min-width` - property is used to set the minimum width that a box can be.
  
### Scrollbars

- Lets view what you can do with the scrollbars styles in css:
  - `visible` - Allows the content to overflow the borders of its containing element.
  - `hidden` - The content of the nested element is simply cut off at the border of the containing element and no scrollbars is visible.
  - `scroll` - The size of the containing element does not change, but the scrollbars are added to allow the user to scroll to see the content.
  - `auto` - The purpose is the same as scroll, but the scrollbar will be shown only if the content does overflow.

#### Below this point I will take notes on more advanced CSS stuff than coloring or styling elements:

---

# Visibility
  
- A property called visibility allows you to hide an element from view. You can use this property along with JavaScript to create very complex menu and very complex webpage layouts.
  
  You may choose to use the visibility property to hide error messages that are only displayed if the user needs to see them, or to hide answers to a quiz until the user selects an option.
  
- The style options for visibilty:
  - `visible` - The box and its contents are shown to the user.
  - `hidden` - The box and its content are made invisible, although they still affect the layout of the page.
  - `collapse` - This is for use only with dynamic table columns and row effects.

# Positioning

- CSS helps you to position your HTML element. You can put any HTML element at whatever location you like. You can specify whether you want the element positioned relative to its natural position in the page or absolute based on its parent element. Lets see al the positioning properties:

### relative

- Relative positioning changes the position of the HTML element relative to where it normally appears. So "left:20" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position. ( I really do note get the relative positioning since it just appears to do nothing. I assume the default positioning is relative but I will have to check in the future I am not sure)

### absolute

- An element with position: absolute is positioned at the specified coordinates relative to your screen top-left corner. You can use `left`, `top` properities with it to give margin to the absolute position 

### fixed

- Fixed positioning allows you to fix the position of an element to a particular spot on the page, regardless of scrolling. Specified coordinates will be relative to the browser window.

### z-index

- `z-index` property isnt neccessairly a posititoning subject however I taught it is worth mentioning here. You can use zindex to give presedence over values for example if two divs appread on the same cordinates you can give one of them zindex of 1 and the other 99 which in that case as you can guess the div with 99 valued z-index will appear on top.
