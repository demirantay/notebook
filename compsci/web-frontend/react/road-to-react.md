# Book: Road to React

These are my notes on the book: Road to React

- React was released by Facebook’s web development team in 2013 as a view library, which makes it the ‘V’ in the MVC33 (model view controller). As a view, it allows you to render components as viewable elements in a browser, while its ecosystem lets us build single page applications. While the first generation of frameworks tried to solve many things at once, React is only used to build your view layer; specifically, it is a library wherein the view is a hierarchy of composable components.

# Installation & Configuration

- I am not going to note down how to install react because I have done it numerous times in other note files. However remember that if you download react using `npm` rather than `npx` you have to setup the babel and webpack yourself so remember that but in any case most recommended configuration free waay to install react is using the `create-react-app` command

- As I said above I am not going to note about `create-react-app` command since I already wrote another note file simply dedicated for it.
