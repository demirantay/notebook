# Javascript

- JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

- Advantages of JavaScript:
  - `Less server interaction` -  You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.
  - `Immediate feedback to the visitors` - They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
  - `Increased interactivity` - You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
  - `Richer interfaces` - You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
  
- Limitations of JavaScript:
  - Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
  - JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.
  - JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.
