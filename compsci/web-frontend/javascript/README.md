# JavaScript

- JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

- `Client Side Javascript` -- Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

  The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
  
  The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
  
- `Advantages of Javascript` -- 
  - Less server interaction
  - Immediate feedback to the visitors
  - Increased interactivity
  - Richer interfaces
  
- `Limitations of Javascript` -- 
  - Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
  - JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.

# Syntax

- JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the `<script>... </script>` HTML tags in a web page.

- It is good practice to include your js scripts at the end of your html file because in that way the scripts will make sure that the HTML content is loaded before they get executed. 

- IF you do not want to write js on your html file you can simply include a `module.js` file in your html with adding the `src` attribute to the script element:
  ```html
  <script src="/path/to/your/file.js" type="text/javascript" language="javascript" ></script>
  ```
