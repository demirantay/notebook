- The better thing to do, in my opinion, is to develop a skillset outside WordPress development, and sell your services as a package. The major job descriptions other than “WordPress developer” that most clients need include:
	- SEO professional.
	- Web and graphic designer.
	- Digital marketing: social media marketing, content marketing.
	- Copywriter (requires a deep understanding of both SEO and content marketing).
		
	If you’ve got visual flair, being a designer-developer’s amazing. If you’re good at general problem-solving, learning SEO as a profession is probably a fair amount less complicated than learning WordPress development, and it’s an outstanding combination. If you’re outgoing, so many clients have no idea how to market themselves and are in absolutely desperate need of clarity on that front. 
	
- The truth is that no one person, or even two people, can provide all the skills that an average client needs to make their project really work out in the marketplace. So whatever skills you don’t have in-house, you will need to find a professional connection for. You’ll refer business to these connections, and what’s great is that they’ll refer you business back!
	
	Just to recap, the roles you’ll need to be able to source include:
		- SEO professional.
		- Web and graphic designer.
		- Digital marketing: social media marketing, content marketing.
		- Copywriter (this person needs a deep understanding of both SEO and content marketing).

-	The software you use to interact technically with WordPress should be very simple. Pippin Williamson once told me that he simplifies what’s on his laptop to the extent that he can throw it in a lake and be up and running on a new one 30 minutes later. Coming from the lead of a multi-million-dollar WordPress plugin company, that really means something—a WordPress freelancer can certainly follow suit.

- For a typical client project, I need:
	- Sublime Text for text editing
	- FileZilla for FTP
	- Maybe WAMP for local development (MAMP for Macs)
	- A browser, I like Chrome and the Chrome developer tools
	
	For most clients, that’s honestly it. It’s all free and none of it should take more than an hour to learn at a basic level.
	
- The four major languages of WordPress are, in order of importance, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Key Third Party Technical Tools

- These are the pieces of external WordPress technology—themes, plugins, hosting, and so on—that directly affect your ability to offer value to clients. You should have a go-to solution for each one.

- `1) 
Hosting`: You should always know what host to recommend your clients. For almost any client you’ll be getting as a WordPress freelancer, you should default to SiteGround (or to WP Engine if the client needs or requests managed hosting). See this link for more about hosting: https://wpshout.com/siteground-review-2019/
	
	You should also know when a hosting move is and isn’t worth it. In general, a hosting transfer becomes more attractive if:
	- There’s only one site on the hosting account.
	- The site is early in its lifecycle—so you won’t be migrating dozens of emails, for example.
	- The issues with the current host are actually holding the site back from succeeding, not just annoyances.
		
	The third bullet point is important: painfully slow hosting, SSL mixups, bad or unaccountable tech support, and so on are all major annoyances, but it’s only sometimes the case that these issues represent strategic impediments for the site. If bad hosting is impeding strategy, go ahead and transfer—if it’s just an annoyance, live with it
		
- `2) Form Builder`: Forms are probably the most common method of user interaction on a WordPress site. My go-to is Gravity Forms. There’s stuff it doesn’t do, but it’s a strong first choice for almost any form need until the project convinces me otherwise. Ninja Forms and Caldera Forms are good too. Contact Form 7 is great (and free) for contact forms.I would be very suspicious about relying on any form plugin not on this list

- `Page Builder`: There is now one very, very good WordPress page builder plugin, and it has revolutionized the way I work in WordPress. That page builder is Beaver Builder. In my opinion, every WordPress freelancer should get it now, learn how to use it, and make it the go-to solution any time a client has a page that needs a custom layout. Visit link for more info on page builders: https://wpshout.com/wordpress-page-builder-review/
	
	You should still stay far away from most other WordPress page builder plugins. It’s extremely difficult to build a good page builder in WordPress, and most projects started from the wrong approach entirely (especially basing layout elements on shortcodes). Visual Composer and Divi Builder are the two biggest and remain among the worst.

- `3) Go-To Theme or Theme Shop` : Good themes are tricky to find: the theme marketplace is horribly bloated and distorted by market forces that prioritize empty display over substance and craftsmanship. Starting your site on a bad theme is also one of the easiest ways to make the project go horribly.

	I can recommend the following boutique theme shops, and you should definitely find your own—staying, in general, off ThemeForest in the process:
	- Solo Pine
	- Elmastudio
	- ThemeBeans
	- Codestag
	
	A good article on choosing a theme => https://wpshout.com/choosing-a-well-built-wordpress-theme-a-step-by-step-guide/
	
	You should also know to stay away from two kinds of themes: the thousands of monstrous “everything themes” from ThemeForest; and (sorry guys) any theme from Elegant Themes, including and especially Divi.
	
- `4) Backup and Migration Solution` : I’m not personally as diligent about manual backups as I “should” be, especially because SiteGround has always managed to save my bacon with its own backups on the rare occasions I really have messed something up. (WP Engine‘s outstanding automatic backup system is worth mentioning as a major rationale for their services.) But backups are important, and BackupBuddy is a good default choice.

	For a backup and migration solution that I absolutely love, check out All-in-One WP Migration. I can vouch for the “migration” half of it, which has been an absolutely incredible timesaver. And since it’s taking full snapshots of your site it’s a complete backup solution just about by definition.

- With wordpress you can create:
	- Themes – the look and the feel of the site;
	- Plugins – changes or extends to the behaviour of WP;
	- Widgets – to appear in sidebars and present specific information;
	- Entire WordPress websites – combining themes, plugins, and custom code to create a unique website based on a client’s -	needs; for this, you need fast and secure WordPress hosting;
	- New applications that use WordPress as the backend, using the REST API;
		
- Plugins modify the behaviour of WordPress without touching the core code. PHP is used heavily, so understanding of how to call and write functions is required. They are standalone code that interfaces with WordPress using functions provided by the core code. You can see this link for more info: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-create-wordpress-plugin

- Another useful resource for using SQL with Wordpress:

- If you are making a WordPress powered website for a client, you’ll typically need to create themes and plugins. Any features/functions that are independant of the theme should be a plugin, so that in the future the person can easily switch to a new theme without losing important functions. It’s important to get an accurate picture of what the client wants before formally agreeing to do the work.

- However, first you should make your own themes or plugins and upload them to the WordPress repository. Nothing sells you more than practical experience. The stronger your portfolio, the more likely you are to find higher paying work. Even just creating a demo WordPress site is valuable for your portfolio – some people just need help getting started.

- When making an agreement with a client, it’s important to have recorded proof of your agreement. You should always make a contract that both you and the client must sign. It should clearly state your pay rate for the work and the extent of the work. It should state whether you are charging a flat fee or an hourly rate. There should be an agreed deadline or time frame for delivery to the client. You should also give the client a reasonable amount of time to complete payment upon delivery.
	
	After the work is complete you should send the client an invoice that lists your work, the date it was delivered, the final price, etc.
