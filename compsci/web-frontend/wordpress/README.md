# Wordpress

- WordPress is an open source Content Management System (CMS), which allows the users to build dynamic websites and blog. WordPress is the most popular blogging system on the web and allows updating, customizing and managing the website from its back-end CMS and components.

- The Content Management System (CMS) is a software which stores all the data such as text, photos, music, documents, etc. and is made available on your website. It helps in editing, publishing and modifying the content of the website.
  
- Advantages:
  - It is an open source platform and available for free.
  - CSS files can be modified according to the design as per users need.
  - It is very easy to edit the content as it uses WYSIWYG editor (What You See Is What You Get is a user interface that allows the user to directly manipulate the layout of document without having a layout command).
  - Media files can be uploaded easily and quickly.
  - It offers several SEO tools which makes on-site SEO simple.
  - Customization is easy according to the user's needs
  
- Disadvantages:
  - Using several plugins can make the website heavy to load and run.
  - PHP knowledge is required to make modifications or changes in the WordPress website.
  - Sometimes software needs to be updated to keep the WordPress up-to-date with the current browsers and mobile devices. Updating WordPress version leads to loss of data, so a backup copy of the website is required.
  - Modifying and formatting the graphic images and tables is difficult
