# Basic Usage of Wordpress

<br>

# First Steps

- After you have installed wordpress into your local machine, begin your development by logging into the administration area, or the back end, of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing wp-admin after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin)

- After logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard. This is where the organization of your site begins. At the top of the screen is the area called the toolbar. Click on your site name; it’s a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site

### Basic: WP Administration

- Now that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, it’s time to test drive the `WordPress Administration`. This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the `Dashboard`, a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.

- On the left side of the screen is the `main navigation` menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will “fly out” for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a “parent” navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section. The various menu items are as follows:
  - Dashboard
  - Posts
  - Media
  - Pages
  - Comments
  - Appearance
  - Plugins
  - Users
  - Tools
  - Settings
  
- Click on the Users tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called All Users that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors accounts

- The Appearance, Themes Screen allows you to change the look of your site using different Themes. Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from

### Basic: Writing Posts

- Back in the Administration Screen, take a look at the Posts Screen. You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to write and manage your posts. Part of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. It is very simple to write posts and leave comments to them, assign categories fight with spam. I know that there was lots of new info but no context to it. I will be giving out more information later on another note file. This notefile is just a pointer and an introduction.

### Basic: Using Themes

- There are hundreds of WordPress Themes to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audience’s needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above.

- Also if you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs, or creating your own Theme.

### Basic: Plugins

- Plugin Screen WordPress Plugins are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. If you are familiar with PHP, HTML, and maybe even MySQL, you may be able to customize WordPress to work the way you want by creating your own Plugin.

# Writing Posts

- The WordPress Editor uses blocks to transform the way you create content: it turns a single document into a collection of discrete elements with explicit, easy-to-tweak structure. here are many block types for you to choose from, which you’ll see organized by category and by most recent use. You can edit or move each block independently of other blocks, and individual blocks sometimes come with their own formatting settings for even greater control over layout and function.'
