# Administration Screens

### Common Layout 

- Each Administration Screen is presented in sections, the toolbar (and header), the main navigation, the work area, and the footer. The sections are:
  - `Toolbar` - has links to various administration functions, and is displayed at the top of each Administration Screen. Many Toolbar items expand (flyout) when hovered over to display more information.
  - `Main Navigation` - menu details each of the administrative functions you can perform. At the bottom of that section is a Collapse menu button that shrinks the menu into a set of icons, or to expands to list them by major function. Within each major function, such as Posts, the sub-menu expands (fly-out) when hovered over, and expands fully if an item clicked.
  - `Footer` - at the bottom of each Administration Screen in light shading, are links to WordPress, thanking you for using it, and the version of WordPress you have installed is shown.
  
### Dashboard

The Dashboard tells you about recent activity both at your site and in the WordPress community, and update information:
  - `Welcome` - hows links for some of the most common tasks when setting up a new site.
  - `At a Glance` - Displays a summary of the content on your site and identifies which theme and version of WordPress you are using.
  - `Activity` - Shows the upcoming scheduled posts, recently published posts, and the most recent comments on your posts and allows you to moderate them.
