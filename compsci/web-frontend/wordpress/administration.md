# Administration

- The Administration Screen provides access to the control features of your WordPress installation. There are many admin screens to control different part of your wordpress application. We will briefly touch them and then get into specific details later on.

# Administration Screens

### Common Layout 

- Each Administration Screen is presented in sections, the toolbar (and header), the main navigation, the work area, and the footer. The sections are:
  - `Toolbar` - has links to various administration functions, and is displayed at the top of each Administration Screen. Many Toolbar items expand (flyout) when hovered over to display more information.
  - `Main Navigation` - menu details each of the administrative functions you can perform. At the bottom of that section is a Collapse menu button that shrinks the menu into a set of icons, or to expands to list them by major function. Within each major function, such as Posts, the sub-menu expands (fly-out) when hovered over, and expands fully if an item clicked.
  - `Footer` - at the bottom of each Administration Screen in light shading, are links to WordPress, thanking you for using it, and the version of WordPress you have installed is shown.
  
### Dashboard

- The Dashboard tells you about recent activity both at your site and in the WordPress community, and update information:
  - `Welcome` - hows links for some of the most common tasks when setting up a new site.
  - `At a Glance` - Displays a summary of the content on your site and identifies which theme and version of WordPress you are using.
  - `Activity` - Shows the upcoming scheduled posts, recently published posts, and the most recent comments on your posts and allows you to moderate them.
  - `Quick Draft` - Allows you to create a new post and save it as a draft. Also displays links to the 5 most recent draft posts you’ve started.
  - `WordPress Events and News ` - Latest local events and news from the official WordPress project.
  
- You can update to the latest version of WordPress, as well as update your themes, plugins, and translations from the WordPress.org repositories. In most cases, WordPress will automatically apply maintenance and security updates in the background for you.

### Posts

- Via the All Posts Screen you can select the Post or Posts you wish to add, edit, delete, or view. Multiple Posts can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit feature allows you to change certain fields for a group of Posts. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Post. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Posts you want to edit or delete

- You can also use the category sceen and tag screen that is inside the new post administration screen.
  
  `Categories` : Every Post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. Categories allow the classification of your Posts into groups and subgroups, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation and use of your site.
  
  `Tags` : Tags are the keywords you might assign to each post. Not to be confused with Categories, Tags have no hierarchy, meaning there’s no relationship from one Tag to another. But like Categories, Tags provide another means to aid your readers in accessing information on your blog.
  
### Media

- Media is the images, video, recordings, and files, you upload and use in your blog. Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when writing a Post or Page. Note that the Uploading Files section in the Settings Media Screen describes the location and structure of the upload directory.

### Pages

- A Page is another tool to add content to a WordPress site and is often used to present “static” information about the site; Pages are typically “timeless” in nature. A good example of a Page is the information contained in “About” or “Contact” Pages. A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called Posts, nor should a WordPress Page be confused with the word “page” referring to any web page or HTML document on the Web.

### Comments

- Comments are a feature of blogs which allow readers to respond to Posts. In the Comments Screen you can edit and delete as well as mark comments as spam. Comments that are awaiting moderation can be marked as approved or previously approved comments can be unapproved. Multiple comments can be selected and approved, marked as spam, unapproved, or deleted.

### Apperance

- WordPress allows you to easily style your site by either installing and activating new Themes or customizing existing Themes.

- `Themes`: A Theme is the overall design of a site and encompasses color, graphics, and text. WordPress site-owners have available a long list of Themes to choose from in deciding what to present to their sites’ viewers. The Customize Screen displays the settings that can be customized for a specific theme. For instance, the WordPress default theme provides options that allows the user to set the colors and a background image.

- `Widgets`: Widgets are gadgets or gizmos that allow you to add various pieces of information to your Theme’s sidebar content. Widgets, for example, can be used to add Categories, Archives, Blogroll, Recent Posts, and Recent Comments to your sidebar

### Plugins

- Plugins allow you to add new features to your WordPress blog that don’t come standard with the default installation. There are a rich variety of Available Plugins for WordPress, and with the following Screens, plugin installation and management is a snap.

### Users

- Every blog probably has at least two users: admin, the account initially set up by WordPress, and the user account you, as the author/owner of the blog, use to write posts. If you want a person to be able to post to your blog, that person must have access to a user account; typically, every person will have her or his own user account.

### Settings

- In the Settings Administration Screen are all of the settings that define your blog as a whole: settings which determine how your site behaves, how you interact with your site, and how the rest of the world interacts with your site.

# Dashboard

- From the Dashboard Screen, you can quickly access your site’s content and get glimpses into other areas of the WordPress community. The Dashboard screen presents information in blocks called widgets. By default, WordPress delivers five widgets on this page: At a Glance, Activity, Quick Draft, WordPress Events and News, and Welcome.
