# Boolean Logic

- Boolean Logic and Algebra was invented by a mathematichian named George Boole. The main idea is that the bianry values has two sets of types one is `1` which is true, on and `0` which is false, off

- Boolean operations 
  `(x AND y)` is equal to :
  
  |x|y|AND|        
  |-|-|--|         
  |0|0|0|
  |0|1|0|
  |1|0|0|
  |1|1|1|

  and `(x OR y)` is equal to:
  
  |x|y|OR|
  |-|-|--|
  |0|0|0|
  |0|1|1|
  |1|0|1|
  |1|1|1|
  
  and `NOT(x)` is equal to:
  
  |x|NOT|
  |-|-|
  |1|0|
  |0|1|
 
- After knowing the boolean operations you can now solve some boolean expressions:
  lets see this question:   NOT(0 OR (1 AND 1)) == 0
