# Computer Architecture

- ENIAC was amongst the first computing system designed in the 1940s. In size, it was equal to the size of 3-4 double decker buses. With over 18,000 buzzing electronic switches called vaccum tubes it was no where close in computing abilities as compared to a Laptop in the modern times. You must be wondering, how we were able to squeeze down all the electonic circuits into smaller and smaller packages to the modern design where laptops are mere fraction of inches thick and very lightweight. The invention of `Integrated Circuits` in 1958 made it all possible.
