# Computer Architecture 

A computer consists of four main components

- 1 - Input
- 2 - Output
- 3 - Central Processing Unit(CPU).
- 4 - Memory Unit.

# Input 

- The Computer accepts Coded information through input unit by the user. It is a device that is used to give required information to the computer. e.g., keyboard, mouse, etc.

<br>
<br>

# Output

- THe output sends the processed results to the user. It is Mainly used to display the desired results to the user. It is mainly used to display the desired result to the user as per input instruction. e.g , video monitor, printer and plotter, etc.

# CPU (Central Processing Unit)

- THe central processing unit consists set of register, arithmetic and control circuits, which together interpret and execute instructions in assembly language. The primary functions of the CPU are
  - The CPU transfers instructions and input data from main memory to registers. ie., internal memory.
  - The CPU executes the instructions in the stored sequence.
  - When necessary, CPU transfers output data from registers to main memory.
  
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often called the brain of computer. The CPU is fabricated as a single Integrated Circuit(IC) chip and is also known as Microprocessor . A CPU controls all the internal and external devices and performs arithmetic and logic operations. The CPU consists of three main subsystems; Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Controls Unit(CU) and registers.

### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

- The arithmetic logic unit contains the electronic circuitry that executes all arithmetic and logical operations on the available data. It is used to perform all arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and logical calculation (<,>.+, AND, OR, etc). Logical unit performs comparison of numbers, letters and special characters. ALU uses registers to hold the data that is being processed. *The number and sizes of registers vary from processor to processor.*

### Registers

- Registers are special purpose and high speed temporary memory units. Registers are not referenced by their address, but are directly accessed and manipulated by the CPU during execution. Essentially, they hold the information that the CPU is currently working on. Registers store data, instructions, address and intermediate results of processing.

### Control Unit (CU)

- Control Unit coordinates with the input and output devices of a computer. It directs the computer to carry out stored program instructions by communicating with the ALU and the registers. It organises the processing of data and instructions.

  To maintain the proper sequence of processing data, the control unit uses clock inputs. The basic function of control unit is to fetch the instruction stored in the devices involved in it and accordingly generate control signals.
