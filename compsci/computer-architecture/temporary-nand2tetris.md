# Temporary Nand2Tetris Notes

- In order to run the chip design software you have to run the following command on your terminal
  ```bash
  $ ~/Desktop/nand2tetris/tools/HardwareSimulator.sh
  ```
  All the supplied Nand2Tetris software tools are started in a similar way: just replace HardwareSimulator with the name of the software tool you wish to run.

  |Tool	|Command|
  |--|--|
  |Hardware Simulator	|HardwareSimulator.sh|
  |CPU Emulator	|CPUEmulator.sh|
  |Assembler |	Assembler.sh|
  |VM Emulator	| VMEmulator.sh|
  |Jack Compiler	| JackCompiler.sh|
  
- The big picture of this course is the following things that we will learn to build :

  -  Human taught == Program
  -  High Level language
  -  Compiler
  -  Virtual Machine
  -  Assembler
  -  Machine code --> Computer architecture
  -  Digital Design
  -  CPU, RAM, Chipset
  -  Gate Logic
  -  Electrical Engineering
