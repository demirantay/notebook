# Computer Organization And Design

Notes on the 5th edition book - Hannesy & Patterson

## Chapter 1

- There are 8 main great ideas in Computer Archiecture, view them below in a nutshell:
    - `Moore's Law`: computer architecs must anticipate where the techonolgy will be when the design finishes
    - `Abstraction`: harware doesnt always mean physical, use abstraction like software for efficency
    - `Common Case Fast`: make the common case fast
    - `Parallelism`: get more performance by performing operations in parallel
    - `Pipelining`: a pattern of parallelism that is so important that it needs its own name
    - `Prediction`: in some cases it can be faster to guess and start working rather than wait until you are sure
    - `Hierarcy`: use the "hierarcy of memory" triangle for cutting memory costs
    - `Dependability`: make systems dependable by building strong components that can take over when failure happens
