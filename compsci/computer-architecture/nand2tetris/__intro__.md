# Nand 2 Tetris 

My notes on the book of Nand2Tetris's course by Noam N. and Shimon S.

To run any of the Nand2Tetris Course emulator tools you need to run this command:
```

# Boolean Logic

- Every digital device—be it a personal computer, a cellular telephone, or a network router—is based on a set of chips designed to store and process information. Although these chips come in different shapes and forms, they are all made from the same building blocks: Elementary logic gates

### Boolean Algebra

- Since computer hardware is based on the representation and manipulation of binary values, Boolean functions play a central role in the specification, construction, and optimization of hardware architectures. 

- Every Boolean function, no matter how complex, can be expressed using three Boolean operators only: And, Or, and Not.
