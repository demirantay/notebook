# Recursion

- In this chapter the goals are to: understand that complex problems that may otherwise be difficult to solve may have a simple recursive solution, learn how to formulate programs recursively, understand and apply the three laws of recursion,  understand recursion as a form of iteration, implement the recursive formulation of a problem, understand how recursion is implemented by a computer system.

### What is Recursion

- Recursion is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program.
