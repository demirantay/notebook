# Linked Lists

- A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

- Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.
  - `Link` − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.
  - `Next` − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.
  - `LinkedList` − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.
  
### Linked List Representation

- Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node. following are the important points to be considered.
  - Linked List contains a link element called first.
  - Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next.
  - Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.
  - Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.
  
### Types of Linked List

- Following are the various types of linked list.
  - `Simple Linked List` − Item navigation is forward only.
  - `Doubly Linked List` − Items can be navigated forward and backward.
  - `Circular Linked List` − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.
