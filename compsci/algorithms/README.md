# Algorithms and Data Structures

- *IRC explanation in nutshell: Each Data Structure is like a different styled array or a node and you use algorithms to get the data from the strcutres in a number of different ways *

- Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage.
  
  If you are aware of Object Oriented programming concepts, then a `class` also does the same thing, it collects different type of data under one single entity. The only difference being, data structures provides for techniques to access and manipulate data efficiently.
