# Introducing the Internet 

- The internet is a global network of computers communicating with each other in some way, whether they're sending emails, downloading files, or sharing websites.

- To create a global network of computers, we need:
  - `Wires & wireless`: Physical connections between computers.
  - `IP & DNS`: Addressing schemes to uniquely identify all the computers on the internet.
  - `TCP/IP`: A path-finding strategy for data to get from one computer to a destination computer.
  - `TLS`: Secure mechanisms for sending data without letting everyone else on the internet read it.
  - `HTTP & HTML`: Common protocols and formats for sharing documents and viewing them across any type of computer

# Wires & Wifi: Physical network connections

- To make an internet, we need a way for two computers to communicate with each other, and it needs to work quickly across very long distances. The very first internet connections re-used the copper cables of telephone lines, communicating binary data via pulses of electricity.

  Engineers soon discovered how to send data in fiber optic cables as pulses of light and how to send data wirelessly via radio waves. The internet still uses all of these types of connections, because they each have their own benefits and drawbacks, like faster speed or higher cost.
  
### Transporting bits over wires

- The internet is a network of computers communicating with each other. When humans communicate with each other, we use words and body language. When computers communicate with each other, they use 1s and 0s. That's easy for computers since they already represent all their data in binary.

- `Sending streams of 1s and 0s` -- When computers need to internally represent the number 5 (101 in binary), they can use three wires to represent the 3 bits: one wire on, one wire off, one wire on.

  If a computer wants to send the number 5 to another computer, they can't use as many wires as they want. In fact, they may only have a single wire to send information over. Instead, they can send the number 5 over three time periods: first sending an on pulse (and waiting), then sending nothing (and waiting), then sending an on pulse.
  
  As long as the two computers agree on the time period, then they can transfer information to each other, turning binary data into pulses and turning the pulses back to binary data.
