# Chapter 27: Internet Routing and Routing Protocols

- __`Introduction`__ -- Previous chapters describe the fundamental concept of datagram forwarding, and
explain how IP uses a forwarding table to select a next-hop for each datagram. This
chapter explores an important aspect of internetworking technology: the propagation of
routing information that is used to create and update forwarding tables. The chapter
discusses how forwarding tables are built, and explains how routing software updates
the tables, as needed.

- __`Static Vs. Dynamic Routing`__ -- IP routing can be partitioned into two broad categories: `Static routing` or `Dynamic routing`

- __`Static Routing In Hosts And A Default Route`__ --

- __`Dynamic Routing And Routers`__ --

- __`Routing In The Global Internet`__ --

- __`Autonomous System Concept`__ --

- __`The Two Types Of Internet Routing Protocols`__ --

- __`Routes And Data Traffic`__ --

- __`The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)`__ --

- __`The Routing Information Protocol (RIP)`__ --

- __`RIP Packet Format`__ --

- __`The Open Shortest Path First Protocol (OSPF)`__ --

- __`An Example OSPF Graph`__ --

- __`OSPF Areas`__ --

- __`Intermediate System - Intermediate System (IS-IS)`__ --

- __`Multicast Routing`__ --
