# Chapter 11: Multiplexing and Demultiplexing (Channelzation)

- __`Introduction`__ -- This chapter continues the discussion of data communications by introducing multiplexing. The chapter describes the motivation, and defines basic types of multiplexing
that are used throughout computer networks and the Internet

- __`The Concept Of Multiplexing`__ -- We use the term multiplexing to refer to the combination of information streams
from multiple sources for transmission over a shared medium, and multiplexor to denote
a mechanism that implements the combination. Similarly, we use the term demultiplexing to refer to the separation of a combination back into separate information streams,
and demultiplexor to refer to a mechanism that implements separation

- __`The Basic Types Of Multiplexing`__ -- There are four basic approaches to multiplexing that each have a set of variations
and implementations:
  - 1 - Frequency Division Multiplexing
  - 2 - Wavelength Division Multiplexing
  - 3 - Time Division Multiplexing
  - 4 - Code Division Multiplexing

- __`Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)`__ -- simultaneously sending multiple
carrier waves over a single copper wire or using wavelength division multiplexing to
send multiple frequencies of light over an optical fiber. At the receiving end, a demultiplexor applies a set of filters that each extract a small range of frequencies near one of
the carrier frequencies

  The most significant advantage of FDM arises from the simultaneous use of a
transmission medium by multiple pairs of communicating entities. We imagine FDM
as providing each pair with a private transmission path as if the pair had a separate
physical transmission medium

- __`Hierarchical FDM`__ -- It is possible to build a hierarchy of frequency division multiplexing in
which each stage accepts as inputs the outputs from the previous
stage.

- __`Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)`__ -- When frequency division multiplexing is applied to optical fiber,
prisms are used to combine or separate individual wavelengths of
light, and the result is known as wavelength division multiplexing.

- __`Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)`__ -- The chief alternative to FDM is known as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).
TDM is less esoteric than FDM and does not rely on special properties of electromagnetic energy. Instead, multiplexing in time simply means transmitting an item from one
source, then transmitting an item from another source, and so on

- __`Synchronous TDM`__ -- When TDM is
applied to synchronous networks, no gap occurs between items. The result is known as
Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing. A synchronous TDM system uses roundrobin order to select items

- __`Framing Used In The Telephone System Version Of TDM`__ -- The synchronous TDM mechanism used for digital telephone calls includes a framing bit at the beginning of each round. The framing sequence of alternating 1s and 0s insures that a demultiplexor either
remains synchronized or detects the error.

- __`Statistical TDM`__ -- How can a multiplexing system make better use of a shared medium? One technique to increase the overall data rate is known as statistical time division multiplexing
or statistical multiplexingâ€ . The terminology is awkward, but the technique is straightforward: select items for transmission in a round-robin fashion, but instead of leaving a
slot unfilled, skip any source that does not have data ready. By eliminating unused
slots, statistical TDM takes less time to send the same amount of data.

- __`Inverse Multiplexing`__ -- An interesting twist on multiplexing arises in cases where the only connection
between two points consists of multiple transmission media, but no single medium has a
bit rate that is sufficient. At the core of the Internet, for example, service providers
need higher bit rates than are available. To solve the problem, multiplexing is used in
reverse: spread a high-speed digital input over multiple lower-speed circuits for
transmission and combine the results at the receiving end

- __`Code Division Multiplexing`__ -- A final form of multiplexing used in parts of the cellular telephone system and for
some satellite communication is known as Code Division Multiplexing (CDM). The
specific version of CDM used in cell phones is known as Code Division Multi-Access
(CDMA).
