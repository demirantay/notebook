# Graphics 

- To display a picture of any size on a computer screen is a difficult process. Computer graphics are used to simplify this process. Various algorithms and techniques are used to generate graphics in computers. This tutorial will help you understand how all these are processed by the computer to give a rich visual experience to the user.

# Computer Graphics Basics

- Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures on computer screens with the help of programming. It involves computations, creation, and manipulation of data. In other words, we can say that computer graphics is a rendering tool for the generation and manipulation of images.

- The primary output device in a graphical system is the video monitor. The main element of a video monitor is the `Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)`

- `Raster Scan` -- In a raster scan system, the electron beam is swept across the screen, one row at a time from top to bottom. As the electron beam moves across each row, the beam intensity is turned on and off to create a pattern of illuminated spots.

  Picture definition is stored in memory area called the Refresh Buffer or Frame Buffer. This memory area holds the set of intensity values for all the screen points. Stored intensity values are then retrieved from the refresh buffer and “painted” on the screen one row scanline at a time
  
  Each screen point is referred to as a `pixel`, pictureelement or `pel`.
  
- `Random Scan/VectorScan` -- In this technique, the electron beam is directed only to the part of the screen where the picture is to be drawn rather than scanning from left to right and top to bottom as in raster scan. It is also called vector display, stroke-writing display, or calligraphic display.

  Picture definition is stored as a set of line-drawing commands in an area of memory referred to as the refresh display file. To display a specified picture, the system cycles through the set of commands in the display file, drawing each component line in turn
  
  Random-scan displays are designed to draw all the component lines of a picture 30 to 60 times each second.

- `Application of Computer Graphics` -- Computer Graphics has numerous applications, some of which are listed below −
