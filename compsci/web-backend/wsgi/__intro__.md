# WSGI

- Why we need a web server gateway interface (WSGI)? A traditional web server does not understand or have any way to run Python applications. In the early 1990s they coded a module named `mod_python` for apache which abled to run python code on web servers on Apache. But this was not standarized and not secure therefore python community came up with WSGI as a standart interface that for running python code on web.
