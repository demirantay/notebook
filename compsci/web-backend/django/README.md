# Django

- Django is a web development framework that assists in building and maintaining quality web applications. Django helps eliminate repetitive tasks making the development process an easy and time saving experience.

- The core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture. Before writing detailed explanation about each feature of the framework I would like to give an overview of the features of Django:<br>
  - object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes)  and a relational database ("Model")
  - system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system ("View")
  - regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller").
  - a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing
  - a form serialization and validation system that can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the database
  - a template system that utilizes the concept of inheritance borrowed from object-oriented programming
  - a caching framework that can use any of several cache methods
  - support for middleware classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions
  - an internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals
  - an internationalization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages
  - a serialization system that can produce and read XML and/or JSON representations of Django model instances
  - a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine  
  - an interface to Python's built-in unit test framework
  
- The main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its "contrib" package, including:
  - an extensible authentication system
  - the dynamic administrative interface
  - tools for generating RSS and Atom syndication feeds
  - a "Sites" framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applications
  - tools for generating Google Sitemaps
  - built-in mitigation for cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, password cracking and other typical web attacks, most of them turned on by defaul
  - a framework for creating GIS applications (graphical interface systems)
