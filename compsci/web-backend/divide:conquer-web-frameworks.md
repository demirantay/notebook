# Divide and Conquer: Web Frameworks

- **Definition:** Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse

- Since the framework that I am going to build is going to mirror most of Djangos features, I will list down the major features of Django at the bottom of the file.
