# HATEOAS - Important Concept For REST API

- HATEOAS stands for Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State. Now what does it mean and why this is important. It's a well agreed belief that a good written software is the one which has a good documentation. But there is little deviation in this belief when it comes to the Rest API. A Rest API is said to be perfect if it doesn't need any documentation at all. It should be so crystal clear to the developer who is consuming the service that he/she should not even refer to the documentation
