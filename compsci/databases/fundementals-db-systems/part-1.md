# chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

- Databases and database systems are an essential component of life in modern society: most of us encounter several activities every day that involve some interaction with a database. For example, if we go to the bank to deposit or withdraw funds, if we make a hotel or airline reservation, if we access a computerized library catalog to search for a bib- liographic item, or if we purchase something online—such as a book, toy, or com- puter—chances are that our activities will involve someone or some computer program accessing a database. Even purchasing items at a supermarket often auto- matically updates the database that holds the inventory of grocery items.

  To understand the fundamentals of database technology, however, we must start from the basics of traditional database applications. In Section 1.1 we start by defin- ing a database, and then we explain other basic terms.

### 1.1 Introduction

- Databases and database technology have a major impact on the growing use of computers. It is fair to say that databases play a critical role in almost all areas where computers are used, including business, electronic commerce, engineering, medi- cine, genetics, law, education, and library science. The word database is so com- monly used that we must begin by defining what a database is:

  A database is a collection of related data.1 By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names, tele- phone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded this data in an indexed address book or you may have stored it on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database.
  
  A database can be of any size and complexity. For example, the list of names and addresses referred to earlier may consist of only a few hundred records, each with a simple structure. On the other hand, the computerized catalog of a large library may contain half a million entries organized under different categories—by pri- mary author’s last name, by subject, by book title—with each category organized alphabetically
  
- A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software sys- tem that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications. 

  An application program accesses the database by sending queries or requests for data to the DBMS. A query2 typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction may cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database.
  
  Other important functions provided by the DBMS include protecting the database and maintaining it over a long period of time. Protection includes system protection against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) and security protection against unauthorized or malicious access. A typical large database may have a life cycle of many years, so the DBMS must be able to maintain the database system by allowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time.
  
  It is not absolutely necessary to use general-purpose DBMS software to implement a computerized database. We could write our own set of programs to create and maintain the database, in effect creating our own special-purpose DBMS software.
