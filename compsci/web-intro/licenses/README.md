# Licenses

- The simplest explanation is that open source licenses are legal and binding contracts between the author and the user of a software component, declaring that the software can be used in commercial applications under specified conditions. The license is what turns code into an open source component.

- So in this readme.md file I will try to give explanation in a nutshell for the most common software licesenses. And if in the future I need to have more information about each licesnes I can update this directory to a have more detailed knowledge about each license.

- Check [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/) for more information about software licensing.
