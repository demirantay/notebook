# Operating System

- An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system

  An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

  - Device Management
  - File Management

  - Control over system performance
  - Job accounting
  - Error detecting aids
  - Coordination between other software and users

### Memory Management

- Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address.

  Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it must in the main memory. An Operating System does the following activities for memory management âˆ’
  - Keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., what part of it are in use by whom, what part are not in use.
  - In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.
  - Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.
  - De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has been terminated.
