# Introduction to Operating System

- A computer system has many resources (hardware and software), which may be require to complete a task. The commonly required resources are input/output devices, memory, file storage space, CPU etc. The operating system acts as a manager of the above resources and allocates them to specific programs and users, whenever necessary to perform a particular task

   Therefore operating system is the resource manager i.e. it can manage the resource of a computer system internally. The resources are processor, memory, files, and I/O devices. In simple terms, an operating system is the interface between the user and the machine.

- `Two Views of Operating System` -- `User's View` and `System View` 

  __Operating System: User View__ -- The user view of the computer refers to the interface being used. In these cases, the operating system is designed mostly for ease of use, with some attention paid to performance, and none paid to resource utilization.
  
  __Operating System: System View__ --  The operating system acts as the manager of the resources, decides between conflicting requests, controls execution of programs etc.

- `Operating System Management Tasks` --
  - 1 - Processor management which involves putting the tasks into order and pairing them into manageable size before they go to the CPU.
  - 2 - Memory management which coordinates data to and from RAM (random-access memory) and determines the necessity for virtual memory.
  - 3 - Device management which provides interface between connected devices
  - 4 - Storage management which directs permanent data storage.
  - 5 - Application which allows standard communication between software and your computer.
  - 6 - User interface which allows you to communicate with your computer.

- `Functions of Operating System` --
  - It boots the computer
  - It performs basic computer tasks e.g. managing the various peripheral devices e.g. mouse, keyboard
  - It provides a user interface, e.g. command line, graphical user interface (GUI)
  - It handles system resources such as computer's memory and sharing of the central processing unit(CPU) time by various applications or peripheral devices.
  - It provides file management which refers to the way that the operating system manipulates, stores, retrieves and saves data.
  - Error Handling is done by the operating system. It takes preventive measures whenever required to avoid errors.

# Types of Operating System

- Following are some of the most widely used types of Operating system:
  - Simple Batch System
  - Multiprogramming Batch System
  - Multiprocessor System
  - Desktop System
  - Distributed Operating System
  - Clustered System
  - Realtime Operating System
  - Handheld System
  
- `Simple Batch Systems` -- In this type of system, there is no direct interaction between user and the computer. The user has to submit a job (written on cards or tape) to a computer operator. Then a special program, the monitor, manages the execution of each program in the batch. The monitor is always in the main memory and available for execution.

- `Multiprogramming Batch System` -- In this the operating system picks up and begins to execute one of the jobs from memory If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the system chooses which one to run through the process of CPU Scheduling. In Multiprogramming system, CPU will never be idle and keeps on processing.

- `Multiprocessor System` -- A Multiprocessor system consists of several processors that share a common physical memory. Multiprocessor system provides higher computing power and speed. In multiprocessor system all processors operate under single operating system

- `Desktop System` -- Earlier, CPUs and PCs lacked the features needed to protect an operating system from user programs. PC operating systems therefore were neither multiuser nor multitasking. However, the goals of these operating systems have changed with time; instead of maximizing CPU and peripheral utilization, the systems opt for maximizing user convenience and responsiveness. These systems are called Desktop Systems and include PCs running Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh

- `Distributed Operating System` --

- `Clustered System` --

- `Realtime Operating System` --

- `Handheld System` --
