# Introduction to Game Engineering

- This is the tutorial which will give you a detailed overview of all the internal architecture and components required for Game development.

### What is a Game 

- Well, you all have heard about the term __Game__. A Game can be defined as an activity enrolled for amusement as a prepared form of play that basically undertakes for enjoyment and/or as an educational tool.

### What is a Video Game

- A video game can be defined as a game that runs on electronic devices which involves humans interacting with a user interface(UI) for generating visual responses on any video device like TV screen or computer monitor. In simple words, video games are the digital entertainment platform (which is a form of software) that humans "play" via a computer, TV, smart phones, tablets or other gaming consoles.

### Game Development

- Game development is the procedure of creating video games which involves working on some platform/software to develop the game. The development is undertaken by a game developer which can be one person or a team of `Game Engineers` (for constructing the overall structure and game play), `Designers` (for designing the objects and animations), `Coders` (for coding and giving life to the game including logics, score and other calculations), `Project Manager` (for managing and promoting the game), `Game Tester` (who will test the game after it has been developed to find bugs in the game, if any). All of these human resources come under Game developers and the process of developing the complete game is termed as `Game Engineering`.

# Developing a Good Game

- An important characteristic of game development is that learners and developers should come up with new ideas and a catchy plot. Don't become a skinner (a gamedev who just colors, animates a game with wihich is just "puffed" plagiarism)

### How to Develop a Good Game

- Becoming a good Game developer needs a lot of practice, working on your ideas and a step by step approach. First step, is to come up with a plan/blueprint of the game. Games that doesn't follow proper development methodologies suffer from issues like:
  - Time taken for development is more.
  - Runs over budget.
  - Tends to be unreasonably more buggy.
  
  So, an advice for the new game developers, before proceeding with designing and coding the game, mend a clear goal and figure out what your game needs. This phase of game development is called` Requirement capture` or `Planning phase`

### Game Development is Software development 

- The steps and stages required for a game's development follow similar stages like that of software development, along with a few extra stages for successful completion of the game. Since game development is a major part of the software development industry, therefore game development also goes through the various phases of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) along with some extra phases. Let's explain these phases in details. These stages are:
  - __1) Communucation:__  This is the initial place where the "idea" starts to form
  - __2) Requirement Gathering:__ In this stage, the game development team discusses the requirements to carry on the project and the project manager will decide the number of human resources required for the project. The team will carry out the discussion with varied stakeholders to discuss problems with various domains with a motive to bring out as much information as possible based on their requirements.
  - __3) System Analysis:__ In this stage, the developers will decide the roadmap of the plan for a successful game development till release and try to come up with the best software model (we will discuss about software engineering models in next chapter, in details) appropriate for the project
  - __4) Systems Design:__ In this phase of development, desired features and detailed work, which includes game-play, setting up of objectives and levels, screen layouts, player and game object model; creating animations in game, business rules, process diagrams (UML, DFD), pseudo-code and other documentations (GDDs) are done.
  - __5) Development Phase:__ The real code for your game will be written in this phase. This can be from a pseudo code or a set of algorithms written in the GDD (Game Design Document).
  - __6) Integration and Testing Phase:__ In this phase, a demo version of the game is released, with a trial period of 15 days or 1 month. This is done officially by the team itself to check for errors and popularity. With this partial release of game, the promotion is also started on websites like YouTube and other gaming sites
  - __7) Final Release Phase:__ After completion of testing and promotion, final release of the game is done.
  - __8) Maintenance Phase:__ In this phase of development, proper maintenance of the game is ensured. It is checked that whether the game is working smooth or becoming obsolete, and along with that feedbacks from the users of that game is collected, analyzed and used to improve the game itself
  - __9) Patches and Cheat-Codes:__ The team themselves release patches(hot fixes for bugs) and cheat codes so that the players which are newbie are also motivated to play the complete game and find interest in proceeding the levels at ease. Also mods (modifiers) are also released after 6-10 months of game release, which are also patches that updates the game to add additional features and functionalities

# Game Development Lifecycle Models

- Since in the last chapter, there were a lot of topics/terms which were left unexplained, so let's try and help you understand the whole picture. First let us discuss about the software/game development lifecycle models which are usually followed in the corporate or individual firms.

### LifeCycle Models

### Waterfall Model

### Spiral Model

### Iterative Model

### V-shaped Model

### Big-Bang Model

### Agile Model
