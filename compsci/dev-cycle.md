`Break the problem down` : It is much easier to solve a series of small problems as opposed to one large problem.

- There are two ways I like to tackle this. Both will work nicely, it's just a matter of which you prefer or which suits the particular problem better.
  - 1 - Break the problem in 1/2. Then break each of those problems in 1/2. Keep doing this until the problems are nice and manageable.
  - 2 - Identify the easiest thing you can do which will get you closer to the solution and do that. Now identify the next easiest step and do that. Repeat until you have a fully working solution
  
  You can also mix the two together, it is the ultimate way of doing it. First break down the modules into pieces and then start connecting the easiest pieces that will get you to the end goal and re-iterate with lesser valuable pieces. For example while developing youtube the __video upload__ part is more important than __help center__ app

`Experience Levels`: Blooms Taxonomy is a way of distinguishing different levels in terms of a persons general ability or skill level. Here is my summarised version tailored to problem solving.

- LvL 0 - I can identify what the actual problem is and what's causing it.
- LvL 1 - I can find/ identify an existing solution (created by someone else) and am able to apply it.
- LvL 2 - I can take a pre-made solution and tweak it to better suit this particular problem.
- LvL 3 - I can create my own solutions and don't need the help of others.
- LvL 4 - I can evaluate a solution and identify how good/ robust/ elegant it is.
