# Vi Text Editor

- Vi is a text editor that is most likely very different to any editor you have used before. Vi/m is its successor with better more readable and fancy colors for modern use. Vi is a very powerful tool. In this section my aim is not to cover everything that Vi can do but to get you up and running with the basics.

### A Command Line Editor

- Vi is a command line text editor. As you would be quite aware now, the command line is quite a different environment to your GUI. It's a single window with text input and output only. Vi has been designed to work within these limitations and many would argue, is actually quite powerful as a result

  As a result you have to ditch the mouse. Everything in Vi is done via the keyboard.
