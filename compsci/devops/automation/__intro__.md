# Automation

- First lets see what wikipedia is saying about atomation "Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance."

- Automation covers applications ranging from a household thermostat controling a bolier to a large industrial control systems with tens of thousands of input measurments with thousands of machines. The control complexity of the automated system can range from just one input measure to a multi input high level algorithm solution.

- The main basis of `automation theory` that was found in 18th century is > open loop control and close loop control with feedback. (there are many ways to write this "loop" like discerete control, pid control however you get the idea)
