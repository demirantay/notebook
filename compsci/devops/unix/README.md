# Getting Started 

- The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user. The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the `operating system` or the `kernel`.
  
- Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the `shell`. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.
  - There are various Unix variants available in the market. Solaris Unix, AIX, HP Unix and BSD are a few examples. Linux is also a flavor of Unix which is freely available.
  - Several people can use a Unix computer at the same time; hence Unix is called a multiuser system.
  - A user can also run multiple programs at the same time; hence Unix is a multitasking environment.
  
- The main concept that unites all the versions of Unix is the following four basics âˆ’
  - `Kernel` - The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.
  - `Shell` - 
  - `Commands and Utilities` -
  - `Files and Directories` -
