## Python

- This is how your write the famous "Hello, World!"
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
<br>

- If you want to run your python programs you do not have to compile the files since python is a interpreted language
  ```bash
  $ python file.py  # Runs the code
  ```
<br>
  
- You do not need to define variables with their type as their prefix like in java, c, c++, and remember while printing vars python does not concetante and convert ints to str's while printing with `+` you must use `,` between. simply put it like this:
  ```python
  name = "foo"
  age = 19
  decimal_num = 3.14159
  is_right = True
  
  print("Name: ", name, " is ", age, " years old")
  ```
<br>

- Most of the types are mutable in python there are types that are immutable but it is not as strictly types as java or C, so you can do the following:
  ```python
  name = "foo"
  name = 5
  
  print(name)  # prints `5`
  ```
<br>

- You can get the user input with `input()` and you can pass a string argument to it if you want the arguemnt to appear while taking user input, input() gets string so you must use `int(input(..))` for getting integer input.
  ```python
  text = input("Type a text: ")  # Gets `str` type input
  
  number = int(input("Type a number: ))  # Gets `int` type input
  ```
