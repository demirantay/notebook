# Consistency Is the Key: Building Trust in the Workplace

- In the workplace, it’s all about consistency. If you’re not consistent in your practices, employees won’t trust you—or each other. One way to make sure everyone is on the same page is to distribute documents that outline the company’s policies and guidelines. If your company doesn’t have such documents already, don’t just leap to your keyboard to begin writing your own policies. Talk with your superiors first. A written policy, even something you send out as an e-mail or a memo, represents your company. Its content can have legal ramifications. Many companies even have policies that outline the process for writing new or revising existing policies and procedures.

  Consistency is crucial not only because it establishes standardized procedures but because it also affirms fairness. Even if employees (or managers) disagree with human resources (HR) policies or department procedures, they will accept them when they know everyone else must, too
  
- `Finding the right body language` -- A closed posture implies a closed mind. Folding your arms across your chest and crossing your legs is a classic defensive posture that delivers the message, “Don’t mess with me.” Rarely is this a message that’s appropriate in the workplace. Your tendency to take this posture may be defensive, a subconscious effort to protect yourself from bad news or negative feedback.

# The Importance of Listening: Be an Active Listener

- It’s important to listen between the lines to hear the unspoken messages. Pay attention to unspoken signals and nonverbal cues. When an employee says, “Yes, I’d be happy to research that information” in a high-pitched, tense voice, and she crosses her arms across her chest before she speaks, what is she really telling you? That she has enough work already without taking on more time-consuming assignments? That she’s cold and wishes she’d brought her sweater to the meeting? That she can’t stand the database librarian she’ll have to contact to request the information? You can’t know without asking further questions, but you should know there’s more to the answer than the words she’s spoken.

- `nonverbal language` -- Words are only a small percentage of the typical communication process—just 7 percent, in fact. Body language and nonverbal cues account for 55 percent, while 38 percent is the tone of voice. Dialogue that takes place over the telephone is missing over half the content of typical communication!

- The art of effective listening is essential to clear communication, and clear communication is necessary to management success.”

# Effective Teamwork: Function As a Cohesive Unit

- Some groups come together or “click” from the first time their members meet, while others labor for months or longer to be something other than separate and competing personalities. Creating an effective work group is part planning and part luck.

  we often talk about the “chemistry” among group members as being critical to the group’s success. Changing just one member often alters the group far beyond that one member’s role and responsibilities.
  
- `effective teamwork` -- Individual personalities and work styles significantly influence the team’s collective identity. The most effective teams contain complementary, not necessarily similar, personalities and work styles. In such a setting, the whole truly becomes more than the sum of its parts: a team. Each person’s strengths overlap the others’ weaknesses.
Sometimes teams form around job responsibilities. Certain people in marketing, like the PR group, are a natural team, as is the production control or quality control group in manufacturing

- `where do you fit in` -- As the work group’s manager, shouldn’t you be the team’s leader? Well, yes and no. You are the leader in that you’re the one with the authority to make decisions, and you will usually be the one held accountable for the group’s actions, performance, and productivity. But in most situations, the manager isn’t a team member. It’s nearly impossible to be a team member and an authority figure concurrently. Teams function most effectively when there is a relatively even distribution of power so that each team member feels he or she is making an equitable contribution

  It’s your job to be sure everyone knows his or her role and responsibilities, and the roles of other members. And you’ll need to be available to serve as facilitator, mediator, teacher, mentor, cheerleader, coach, and parent—whatever the group needs.
  
 - `Do They Have to Like Each Other to Be Effective?` -- As much as we’d like to think professionalism transcends petty matters like popularity, the reality is that people who like each other get along better. Certainly a team whose members provide complementary skills can function competently and even productively
 
 - `traits of an effective team` -- Effective teams share certain characteristics. First, they have a clear sense of mission or purpose, and they have clear goals. To be productive, team members need to know why they’re working. When a work team knows its mission or purpose (reason for existing) and its goals (desired accomplishments), its members are more likely to focus on activities that move the group closer to completion—of tasks, of projects, of products or services.
 
  Each member feels he or she has the fundamental right to a level of trust that precludes backstabbing, gossip, and other negative behaviors. Members instead provide positive encouragement and work cooperatively to achieve common goals.
  
  Lastly, effective teams receive appropriate external support. Even the most self-sufficient, effective work teams can’t function in a vacuum. They need you and your superiors (often viewed collectively as “the company”), and sometimes other departments or work groups, to provide the resources required to achieve their goals. 
  
- `make a fresh start` -- When it becomes necessary to resolve a problem with an employee who reports to you, always offer the opportunity for a fresh start. The person should not feel compelled to continue a certain pattern of behavior with you. No matter the trail of angry words that follow the person into your office, stop them at the threshold. This lessens the pull of past behavior (however immediate that past is) and allows you to break off onto a new path that hopefully leads to resolution.

# Responsibility and Accountability: Keys to Your Success

- As an employee, you were responsible for completing job tasks and work projects. You may have had limited authority to delegate certain responsibilities to others, but for the most part the line of authority ran in the other direction. Your manager delegated to you, and you carried out the assignment, though your manager bore the brunt of accountability for how well you did your work. When you succeeded, your manager got the bulk of the credit. When you failed, your manager took the fall.

  You’re a manager yourself now. How you handle responsibility and accountability is often the single most important aspect of your position as manager and the key to your future success in management.
  
- `dont isolate yourself` -- Employees need you to stop by every day and say hello. When you don’t, they may assume something is wrong, or they may feel ignored. And when you don’t interact with your employees, you begin to assume that they think and act in certain ways. From these assumptions, you draw conclusions that they are doing, or not doing, certain things. When we don’t have information, we make it up. This is true for managers and employees alike.

<br>

# Daily Interactions with Your Employees: Making It Personal

- It’s amazing that many managers don’t interact with their employees any more than they have to. This creates discomfort on both sides Is small talk hard for you? That’s okay. Communication is a craft each of us must learn. Although the ability to talk seems natural enough, circumstances that require structured dialogue can make otherwise competent adults sputter incoherently. So consider small talk just one of the new skills you must learn to excel at your job as a manager.

<br>

# What Works for Them Works for You: Continuous Learning

- As a manager, working hard to support your employees with job training and skill improvement activities can make you feel really good. Go ahead and take a minute or so to enjoy the good feeling. Then take a few steps back and look at the bigger picture. Unless you’re a working manager with job responsibilities that are similar to those of the employees you manage, it’s probably not necessary for your skills to match those of your employees. Still, you need to know enough about their jobs to determine whether your employees need additional training and if so, in what.

<br>

# Growing Good People: Training and Improving Your Team

- Once, perhaps back when you first entered the workforce, it was enough to land a job. It wasn’t so long ago that working people were happy to simply receive paychecks, and employers were glad to have productive employees. But times have changed. Today, both employers and employees recognize that there’s a difference between a job and a career. People no longer stay in the same job or work for the same company for all of their working lives.

  Your company entrusts you with its most valuable resource—employees. It expects you to help your employees develop their skills and careers. Sometimes you want to do this anyway because your employees are good people who work hard and you want to see them grow. You don’t want to lose them, and you know they might quit without appropriate support. Sometimes you need employees to grow so that they can take on more responsibilitie
  
  If employees don’t feel like they are growing, they become stagnant.
Over time, the department too will become stagnant and so will the organization. It often doesn’t require that much for you to provide the learning opportunities that your employees want and need. You might try the following:

  A key element of retaining the best people is to give constant feedback. In fact, some employees will request this and will function less well if they don’t get it Although of course office politics come into play with all people (even you) at times, there’s a strong likelihood that these employees are just people who need the sense of structure that constant feedback provides. 
  
  This is reality—for you and for your employees. Make sure they each have the same opportunities to showcase their successes and achievements for you and they’ll be more likely to stay with the company. Just be sure you know whether that apple-polishing employee is advancing the goals of the team and the company or is just feeding the beast. Take the time to ferret out the true objective before you come to a conclusion.

# Managing Distanced Employees: Working with Telecommuters

- As of 2016, it was estimated that at least 60 million people in the United States worked away from their offices at least some of the time. This number has grown since, and there’s every reason to think it will continue to do so. The improvement of communication technology makes telecommuting a viable option for almost everyone. With this growth has come increased challenges for managers of remote employees.

- `geographically dispersed teams` -- These days it’s not unusual for some team members—possibly including some management teams—to be separated from one another by many miles, or even

- `what makes a good telecommuter` -- If a member of your team asks to work from out of the office, full time or part time, you should consider some questions about her or him.
  - Is the person results-oriented, with excellent communication skills?
  - Does she have a solid knowledge of her job with a good understanding of corporate goals and objectives?
  - Is she organized, with good time-management skills?
  
  If the answers to these questions are yes, go on to consider the job itself as well as the atmosphere in which the employee will be working.
  
- `avoid isolation` -- One of the biggest issues that you must deal with in managing remote employees is preventing them from feeling isolated, cut off from the rest of the company. This can be a bigger problem for those workers who telecommute all the time rather than just a few days a week. Steps you can take to prevent this include:
  - Have regular team meetings in which the telecommuting employee participates
  - Schedule times when the telecommuter comes into the office to get face time with her fellow workers, as well as face-to-face meetings with you and other managers
  - Have weekly phone calls with the employee
  - If company-wide meetings are held, arrange for the employee to listen live. If this isn’t possible, send a recording of the meeting to the employee
  
<br>

# Does Money Matter?: The Importance of Salary

- Especially in times of economic upturn when there are more opportunities to switch jobs, employees look for positive reasons to stay with a company. One of the most important of these reasons is salary, whick makes it easier for workers to meet their material needs

- `salary versus benefits` -- According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, an employee’s salary represents about three-fourths of the company’s direct compensation costs for having the employee on staff. Benefits (such as insurance, paid time off, and retirement plans) account for the remainder.

- Never ask for details of an employee’s financial circumstances. If she or he wants to tell you, that’s fine, but it’s a sensitive subject, and you shouldn’t pry. If a worker wants more money, let him or her explain why.

- `the productiviy sweet shop` -- Some people require constant direction, feedback, and redirection. Others are better left to a general framework within which they are free to structure the job’s tasks, flow, and progress measures. Consider how each employee works most productively, and then shape your oversight and interactions such that they are appropriate within the context of the employee’s work style.

<br>

# Channeling Creative Energy: Promoting Innovation

- Creativity and productivity are not mutually exclusive, although channeling creativity into productivity can be a significant challenge for a manager. You just need to identify people who are naturally creative thinkers and make sure they have the flexibility—in terms of assignments and environment—to express their creativity
  - Present assignments in general terms, explaining the desired end result but allowing employees the latitude to find their own ways to that result. Establish timelines to keep productivity on track, but don’t structure the work process.
  - Allow people to express risky ideas without immediately shooting them down. “Let me play devil’s advocate” is the surest way to cut creative thinking off at the knees.
  - Let people work through mistakes to find their own solutions, and allow time for this as part of the creative process. It takes a lot of coal to make diamonds.
  
  Remember, though, that new approaches are sometimes threatening. Employees and managers feel like their necks are on the line these days, and no one likes to take risks that will stretch theirs. No company, no matter what its products or services, can thrive (or even survive) without fresh ideas.
  
- `creative jobs` -- Although you can find them in just about any job, creative people tend to gravitate toward creative jobs—work that requires them to come up with new processes or products. These jobs are often in fields such as advertising, marketing, electronic media, publishing, design, and architecture. You might define these people as writers, artists, or programmers, or they might have a combination of talents that defies definition.

  Creative people tend to make managers a little nervous—it’s hard to tell sometimes whether they’re working or goofing off, and they seem a bit, well, unleashed

# Recognizing and Nurturing Potential: The Inner Light

- Cultivate the talents and abilities of people who already work for your company whenever possible. Your company already has a considerable investment in its employees, and statistics show that employees promoted from within are more likely to succeed as managers than are new hires brought into management positions.

  As a manager, you have the obligation to help employees identify their potential (that is, you have to put on your coach or your mentor hat). The first step is to ask the employee what he or she wants to achieve, and what route appears likely to travel in that direction 
  
  To help cultivate an employee’s potential, you could do the following:
  - Send the employee to several work-related seminars and conferences each year.
  - Invite the employee to accompany you to a meeting or event that he or she otherwise wouldn’t be able to attend.
  - Incorporate a discussion of future goals and objectives into every formal performance evaluation, including follow-ups from previous evaluations.
  - Ask each employee several times a year what you can do to support his or her career aspirations. Pay attention to goals that change; goals should change if the employee is making any progress toward meeting them.
  
<br>

# The Risks of Playing Favorites: A Danger to Avoid

- Favoritism is generally a personal matter. A manager likes someone, so he or she gives that person breaks. Sometimes favoritism is obvious; other times it’s subtle. In every case, however, favoritism divides. It pits employees against each other (not always consciously), forcing them to compete for your attention

  Sometimes favoritism arises from a genuine desire to do something good for an employee that then evolves into a mentor-turned-monster scenario. Often favoritism exists as a form of office politics, with employees jockeying for position in the kiss-my-shoes line.
  
- `star players` -- When an employee truly does bring a special and highly valued talent or ability to your department, of course you must recognize that in some way. High performers need constant challenges to keep them interested and motivated. They need new responsibilities, recognition and praise, and higher salaries. At the same time, it’s important—and essential—for you to make it clear that you are committed to providing opportunities for all employees who report to you. As valuable as one person might be, your department cannot succeed in meeting its goals without the full cooperation and collaboration of all its members.

- “Practice Golden-Rule 1 of Management in everything you do. Manage others the way you would like to be managed.” —Brian Tracy, business consultant

- The business world is no different. When “star players” come into the company at inflated salaries or with other benefits that other employees don’t get, it’s difficult to maintain any sense of fairness. And when entire companies build around such inflation, it doesn’t take a crystal ball to see that eventually the balloon will pop.

<br>

# Realistic Goals: Getting Everyone on the Same Page

- People are most likely to accept and comply with performance standards if they have a role in establishing them. In many companies and industries, certain standards are carved in stone— set by regulation or outside authority, or are inherent in the work. Hospitals, colleges, universities, and other kinds of organizations are subject to quality expectations established by accrediting bodies. Failing to meet these standards means they cannot remain in business.

- `the importance of performance standarts` --  Performance standards, while somewhat bureaucratic, are also a way of ensuring both the perception and practice of fair treatment—which is something managers and employees alike desire.

- `support individual growth` -- Employees are not at their jobs simply because they have nothing to do all day or because they want to save the world. They want to grow or at least to make more money. And they want you, their manager, to show them how they can do this. Any performance evaluation process should include short- and long-term personal goals
  - What steps does the employee need to take to grow in the job and the department? What reward can the employee expect for achieving such growth?
  - Where can the employee expect to go next in his or her career? 
  - What are the employee’s prospects a few years down the road?
  
  If you can’t help an employee honestly define his or her next career goal, you’re showing the employee a brick wall.

# Make Your Day Productive: Streamline Your Tasks

- Most people have at least some difficulty in managing their time. The solution to effective time management lies in your attitude. People who admit they have difficulty with time management will be 90 percent closer to solving the problem when they take responsibility for their own actions. There are only so many hours a day, and it’s up to you how to spend them—either doing the work that’s supposed to be done or letting interruptions and other distractions take time away from what you need to do.

- `Urgent Is Not Necessarily Important` -- It’s amazing how easily we confuse “urgent” with “important.” For example, what happens when the phone rings? Ninety-nine percent of the time, you pick it up. Telephones seem to have a way of instilling a feeling of urgency; by the very act of their ringing, they demand to be answered.

  But the telephone itself isn’t the problem. Rather, it’s the issue being conveyed by the caller, often some “urgent” but minor problem. Just because something is “urgent” does not always mean that it is important. Yet because of their very immediacy, and the fact that they often center on deadlines, urgent items always seem to gain priority.

  So how do we separate the wheat from the chaff so to speak, the urgent from the important? First, simply try not to react to pressure over an urgent item. Add it to your to-do list and prioritize it (high, medium, or low), based on both “urgency” and “importance.” Deal with other items in the same way, remembering that:
  - High urgency is the need for something to be done immediately.
  - High importance is that which relates to a crucial objective—that is, something with a real impact.
  
  Then look at your to-do list and decide in what order the various tasks should be done. Tasks high in both urgency and importance are done immediately, with the necessary time spent on them. Items that are urgent but unimportant should be done quickly, but you should not spend much time on them. It might help to set a time limit for each item.

- `Any System Is Fine As Long As It Is Yours` -- Let’s face it, there’s a lot of pressure to purchase the latest “bell and whistle” that will supposedly help us master time, whether it’s an electronic system, an all-in-one cell phone, or an expensive leather planner.  Regardless, as a consequence only a small part of the system is actually used if it’s used at all.

  In truth, any system will work, as long as it’s compatible with your work habits. If writing a to-do list on the back of an envelope works, then do that. Likewise, if using a very expensive leather-bound system makes you feel good and spurs you to manage your time more effectively, that’s fine too. Bottom line: Your system must suit you and your work habits and style.

- `Don’t Rush Around Aimlessly—Organize a Routine Day` -- There are, in most jobs, a series of routine tasks that must be done regularly—read the mail, check and sign the expenses, prepare the monthly report, and so on. These tasks are usually fairly boring. Some of us look for any excuse to do something far more interesting and enjoyable, and reacting to incoming demands can seem a justifiable way of avoiding mundane tasks.

  However, you can get to everything that needs to be done by spending the first ten minutes of your working day dividing tasks into two areas: tasks you must do and tasks you would like to do, if there is time.

  It’s the 80:20 rule yet again . . . 80 percent of our interruptions are caused by 20 percent of the people.
  
  Even though most of us play office politics in one form or another, remember you have control of your level of involvement. You can stand around the water cooler and chat, or you can bring your own bottled water and get your work done.
  
- `Expect the Unexpected` -- Consider a recent daily plan and ask yourself whether you completed it. If you only did most or some of it, why was that? The most likely reason your plan was wrecked was because of unexpected demands on your time. “Hold on though,” you may say. “I can’t plan for the unexpected, can I?” In fact, you appear to allocate something close to eight hours of work to be done in an eight-hour day. In other words, there’s no leeway for the unexpected, and when it does arise, the plan is disrupted. How realistic is it to plan eight full hours of work during an eight-hour day?
One to two hours—maybe more—of your day are likely to be spent “putting out fires.” You can’t plan for the actual tasks that arise, but you can allocate time for the unexpected! Keep a log for a few days to see how much time you spend on unforeseen tasks.
  Once you get an average figure, allow for it in your daily plans. Suppose that handling unanticipated issues takes two hours each day. This means you should plan for about six hours’ worth of work. Although such planning is an inexact science, you are more likely to accomplish the designated tasks because you’ve set them within a more realistic time frame.
