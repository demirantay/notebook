# Introduction

- Like everything else in the workplace today, the concept of what it means to be a manager is changing. And it’s not getting any easier. The workplace has become a complex environment that includes faster and faster communication, swiftly changing economic circumstances, remote workers (sometimes on another continent), and data spitting in all directions. The workforce has changed: It’s younger, more technologically savvy, and more diverse in every way.

  A manager is responsible for directing a group of employees or a project. This sounds pretty simple, but it’s really not. The Wall Street Journal cites management guru, the late Peter Drucker, to this effect: A manager sets objectives; organizes; motivates and communicates; measures; and develops people. “While other management experts may use different words and focus on different aspects of these responsibilities,” says the Journal’s writer, “Mr. Drucker’s basic description of the manager’s job still holds.” At its heart, good management is all about teamwork.
  
  You’ll be judged as a manager, to a great extent, by how your team functions and the outcome of your project.

# The Flavors of Organisation

- Look up the word manager on the Internet or in any reference book and you will find many different definitions. They range from the coach of a sporting team to an individual hired to manage a celebrity’s business or personal affairs to a computer server that provides the communication link between the systems administrator and affiliated devices on a network. But the most common definition is of someone responsible for directing or organizing a group of employees or a project

  Managers of various organizations and companies come in many “flavors”—they can be directors, group or section leaders, various vice presidents, chief operating officers, even heads of boards of directors. In the truest sense, even the president of the United States is a manager.
  
  According to management expert Bill Warner, despite their varying responsibilities all managers have several things in common: They are leaders, project managers, and coaches who use department resources—both people and equipment—to get the job done. They develop strategies, organize the department, set priorities and make decisions, place and ensure the training of their workers, delegate responsibilities, find solutions, make sure employees have adequate resources to do the job, communicate with department and outside sources, and represent (both internally and externally) and help determine company policy.
  
- `The Function of Management: The 80:20 Rule` -- The 80:20 rule states that you will often find an (approximately) 80:20 ratio between related factors. For example:
  - 80 percent of the sales revenue derives from 20 percent of the customers. 80
  - percent of the problems are caused by 20 percent of the people.
  - 80 percent of the results come from 20 percent of the activities.
  
  With this in mind, you can begin to understand the importance of focusing on the 20 percent that needs to be attended to at any given moment. Focusing on the 20 percent allows managers to prioritize how they spend their time. Because new managers often lack experience, they typically find that their schedule fills up quickly because they try to do everything. Prioritizing enables the manager to have an impact without spending sixty hours a week in the office.
  
  The 80:20 rule enables you to weed out the problems and concentrate on the areas that need improvement. It will also help you identify strengths within your organization, as well as benchmark high achievers.
  
- `From “Being Managed” to Manager` -- So how do you make the transition from a good worker who produced solid results— resulting in your promotion—to managing others and achieving the same (or greater) level of success

  The first step is managing yourself. This includes obvious areas like staying in shape, eating and sleeping well; being accountable for your actions As a manager, you’ll be leading by example, and you will set the tone for your entire department. Your responsibilities include. motivating your team members to do the best work possible and shaping the team into a cohesive unit that gets the job done. So you’ll want to set a standard for personal excellence
  
   The latter is especially important in obtaining cooperation from employees, who must feel that you are loyal and that they can trust you. They also need to be comfortable coming to you with their ideas and sense that you will act upon their feedback and suggestions.
  
  > “In most cases being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way.”
    ―Tina Fey, Bossypants
    
  Employees will do their best when working for someone who they believe in and can turn to. They also expect you to be more than competent in, if not on the cutting edge of, your area of expertise.

# Understanding the Corporate Culture: How Things Are Done
  
- Corporate culture is often defined as “how we do things around here,” and it reflects the organization’s personality, attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and values If you’re going to be a successful manager, it’s essential that you understand the culture of your workplace and act according to it rather than against it.

  Theories abound that explain corporate culture. Among the most insightful and commonly used is a model from MIT professor Ed Schein, who describes it as existing on three cognitive levels. At the first or “surface” level are the attributes that can be seen by the outside observer—physical layout, dress code, how employees interact with each other, the company’s policies and procedures, and organizational structure. The next “middle” level consists of the professed culture of the company: its mission statements, slogans, and stated values. At the third and deepest level are the organization’s tacit assumptions, the “unspoken rules” that are rarely consciously acknowledged even by the employees. Here you’ll find taboo and sometimes contradictory elements of company culture
  
  Not only must managers understand all three levels of a culture, but they must also know how to navigate the complex and often-conflicting third level, a task that requires the utmost tact and sensitivity. It is in this third level that managers face their greatest challenge
  
  The best way to prevent inadvertent slip-ups is to find a peer or manager who can help you understand the more subtle nuances of accepted practices.
  
- `The four cultures` -- It’s useful to understand which type of corporate culture you’re dealing with. Terrence Deal and Allan Kennedy, in their book Corporate Cultures, describe four different kinds of culture:
  - Work-hard, play-hard culture (rapid feedback/reward and low risk—restaurants and software companies).
  - Tough-guy macho culture (rapid feedback/reward and high risk—police, surgical units, sports).
  - Process culture (slow feedback/reward and low risk—banks, insurance companies). 
  - Bet-the-company culture (slow feedback/reward and high risk—aircraft manufacturers, Internet ventures).

- As a manager, you should wholeheartedly support your company’s culture, even if you don’t agree with parts of it. Change is more easily effected if it’s perceived as friendly and coming from within the organization, rather than from an external, potentially hostile force, such as a corporate takeover or outside consultant.

- `Defining Your Role—Get Clear on What You Need to Do` -- Unlike its culture, a company’s mission statement is clear-cut. It conveys to the world what the company is about and what it hopes to accomplish. As a manager, you may want to create your own mission statement, even if it’s concerning a project or department that you’ve inherited from someone else.

  An effective mission statement should cover the following:
  - The department’s purpose and objectives Its 
  - basic philosophy
  - How it plans to serve customers, and the community at large The 
  - department’s standards
  - How the department will make a difference and fit into the overall scheme of things
  
  Writing an effective mission statement is easier said than done. It should summarize principles and ideals in only a few sentences, as in the following example.
  
  > The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center’s Mission, Vision and Values All areas of our organization are driven by our mission: to improve people’s lives through innovation in research, education, and patient care. We also share a common vision: working as a team, we will shape the future of medicine by creating, disseminating and applying new knowledge, and by personalizing health care to meet the needs of each individual. Central to how we carry out our mission and vision are our values: integrity, teamwork, innovation, excellence, and leadership.
  
- `Setting Up Your Management Style` -- The $100,000 (adjusted for inflation) question facing many beginning managers is this: How should I lead? To begin to answer that question, it’s helpful to have a grasp of the most common management styles:
  - An autocratic manager makes all the decisions, keeping the information and decision- making among the senior management.
  - A paternalistic manager makes decisions in an authoritarian manner in what he or she perceives is in the best interests of the employees.
  - A democratic manager allows the employees to participate in decision-making; everything is determined by the majority.
  - A laissez-faire manager takes a peripheral role, allowing staff members to manage their own arenas of responsibility.
  
  None of these styles is the “right” one. Managers can use any of them. You may be more comfortable with one style, or more commonly, a combination of styles. The right style depends upon the corporate culture or what the situation warrants.
  
- `The Importance of Social Interaction` -- Employees often expect their jobs to provide a certain level of social interaction. Going to work is a chance to reconnect with friends and acquaintances. Human beings need this interaction. In most situations, this need is not necessarily incompatible with productivity and efficiency. People work better when they’re happy, and interacting with other people is a way to be happy. The challenge for managers is to keep such interactions appropriate for the workplace.

# Managing Expectations: What Do You and Your Employees Want?
  
- People work for myriad reasons, but most of these reasons figure into three core factors: They want to be entertained, feel appreciated, and earn money. The job description that covers these needs might read, “Our company offers challenging work, opportunities for career growth, and a comprehensive compensation and benefits package.

  Though expectations vary among individuals, three basic needs are common to most people:
    - 1 - To engage in work that is interesting and provides a sense of accomplishment
    - 2 - To feel that the job offers economic stability
    - 3 - To grow toward personal potential
    
    An employee’s expectations begin with the job position posting or advertisement. Someone
—hopefully a person who intimately knows the job’s technical skill requirements and work environment—attempts to summarize the position’s needs 

- My employees expect me to :
  - know what they want, even if they don’t say anything.
  - understand that they have lives away from work that sometimes interfere with work. pick 
  - up the slack for them or intercede in some way when they aren’t able to get their assigned job tasks completed on time.
  - be available at any time of the day to answer questions and resolve problems.
  - treat them fairly, which they define as considering any and all extenuating circumstances before passing judgment or taking action.
  - help them acquire new skills, even if that means they will then become qualified for different jobs.
  - advocate for them when they have needs that require upper management decisions. 
  - occasionally take them to lunch or bring in goodies as a show of appreciation for the good work they do.
  - give them full credit for the department’s successes and take full blame for the department’s shortcomings.
  - always remember that they are only human but to never reveal this about myself.
  
  Most managers will check off seven or eight of these expectations, chuckling over some and groaning over others. Some are not very reasonable or realistic, while others are essential. Some seem selfish—and they are. But all, at some time or another, are valid.
  
  This incident shows the value of treating employees as individuals. People come in all shapes and sizes—especially in today’s diverse workforce. It’s important not to try to cram someone into a place in the organization where she just doesn’t fit.

# Coaching: Bringing Out the Best in Others

- Odds are, you remember a coach from somewhere in your past. Perhaps it was a track coach who pushed you to run faster or jump farther than you thought was possible, or a swim coach who pushed you to the edge of your endurance. Good memories or bad, these are powerful reminders that a single person can have lasting influence in the lives of many others.
As a manager you must focus on the needs and capabilities of each individual on your team. Like a coach,

- An effective coach does a lot of things
  - Provides timely and specific feedback. “Good job!” feels good but says little; “You really nailed the point in your proposal!” lets an employee know what was good.
  - Establishes standards and goals that are high enough to make employees stretch, but not so high that they’re impossible to reach.
  - Tells the truth with kindness and caring—but still tells the truth.
  - Shares ideas and offers suggestions but resists telling employees how to do things. 
  - Teaches people how to cook rather than taking them out to dinner, metaphorically speaking.
  - Helps people look at problems from a new vantage point so that they may understand challenges within the context of the entire company and not just their part of it.
  - Holds employees accountable for their commitments and goals.

# Mentor: Trusted Guide

- Most mentoring is unofficial, though some corporations have structured mentoring programs to groom potential upper-level managers and executives. More typically, a person with expertise takes interest in a subordinate’s career and takes that subordinate under his or her wing. A mentor helps an employee:
  - Set long-term goals and short-term objectives 
  - Explore new directions to achieve goals Identify 
  - personal strengths and weaknesses Find ways 
  - to develop and grow
  
- Mentoring extends beyond teaching in that it relies on establishing a relatively long-term relationship that revolves around sharing and mutual respect. A mentor shares knowledge as well as wisdom—a fine line, perhaps, but a crucial distinction. While knowledge can be learned, wisdom must be acquired

# Teacher: Imparting New Skills
  
- > Good management consists in showing average people how to do the work of superior people.”
    John D. Rockefeller, American oil tycoon
    
- `Creating Boundries` -- Just as parents need to set limits and structure for their children at home, managers need to establish boundaries and organizational frameworks for their employees at work. As a manager, it is your job to tell employees what they can and cannot do. You—and they— don’t have to view this as overly restrictive. Rather, it’s the way you get them to focus on the job at hand.

# Parent Setting Limits

- Many people view the workplace as an alternate home and the people there as surrogate family members. After all, you spend more waking hours at work than at home or anywhere else. Coworkers are pseudo-siblings or pseudo-spouses. And managers become—you guessed it—pseudo-parents.

  You might find yourself repeatedly reminding employees to ask clients if there is anything else they can do for them before rushing to the next call, just as at home you might find yourself repeatedly reminding your kids to unball their socks before putting them in the laundry basket
  
  Remember, though, that you are not, of course, really a parent to your employees, and the work group is not really a family. They have been hired to perform specific tasks and accomplish particular goals. You might be wearing your parent hat too long if any of these things occur:
 

- `Is the realationship good` -- You might find yourself repeatedly reminding employees to ask clients if there is anything else they can do for them before rushing to the next call, just as at home you might find yourself repeatedly reminding your kids to unball their socks before putting them in the laundry basket

# Cheerleader: Rallying the Troops

- People worry about their jobs and their abilities to complete new tasks and assignments. They need someone (you) to rally them back to believing in themselves. As a manager, a major part of your job is to motivate and excite your employees. 

  Cheering on the troops is only effective when the troops know that you truly care— not just about their projects and assignments and meeting your department’s goals, but also about them as people and individuals. And they won’t know you truly care unless you’re involved in what’s going on every day.
  
  This is your role, too. Even when your superiors—or your clients or customers—are unhappy with your team’s work and productivity, you need to stay right there on the sidelines, cheering your team on. If you’ve been there all along, they will respond.

# The Need for Structure: Finding the Balance

- Not all people, no matter how creative, function well in an environment with minimal structure. Some people don’t know how to channel their energy into productive tasks with measurable outcomes. Other people crave—and excel under—close and specific direction. Occasionally you’ll encounter a person who must have external structure because without it he or she simply won’t do any work at all.

  Every company, regardless of its products and services, requires a certain amount of structure. Some functions and departments, such as accounting, are bound to established procedures for conducting their work. People who work in these areas generally (but not always) have work styles and personalities that are compatible with this level of structure.
  
- `let them go` -- For a manager whose personal work style is structured, a key challenge is letting go so that others find their own way. If you have a structured work style, you may resist letting go—but let go you must. Employees will rebel if they feel you have a “my way or no way” approach. Rebellion against excessive structure often takes the form of passive- aggressive behavior such as remaining engaged in a task without answering a ringing phone.

- `structured jobs` -- The backbone of structure is clear communication. Employees need to know what they are expected to do and by when Sometimes employees have trouble prioritizing because they are unfamiliar with the department, the company, or the industry. They have no context for the work they do, so they don’t know what to tackle first. Everything becomes critical in such an environment. As a consequence what gets completed is often frustratingly trivial, and the important stuff gets left undone or is missed completely.

  As a manager, your role is to help employees who need structure establish priorities and processes to support them Generally it’s most effective to meet with employees one-on-one, so you can gauge just how much structure each employee needs.

- `adapt and grow` -- Be willing to revise and adapt. People grow and their needs change, and it’s essential to keep up with both. What an employee self-monitors and what you monitor should evolve over time so that you as manager play a less direct role in sculpting the employee’s daily activities.
Over time, and as the employee’s comfort with the structure progresses, designate daily tasks as part of the employee’s routine, with the employee responsible for making them part of the workweek with less monitoring from you. Schedule brief but regular meetings or other processes to provide feedback and reinforcemen

- `work overload` -- Sometimes an employee’s apparent inability to complete job tasks reflects an overwhelming workload rather than a structure problem. In such situations you might need to reassign job tasks to lighten the load. This could mean realigning work responsibilities among your current employees, hiring temporary employees to help out, or creating new positions to accommodate a growing workload.
  
  Each employee has a slightly different need for structure. It’s important for you as the manager to remain in close contact with all employees so that you can adjust various elements of structure to support their highest levels of productivity. Asking each employee how he or she feels is the most effective way to structure the workday
