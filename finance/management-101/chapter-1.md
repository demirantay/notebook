# Introduction

- Like everything else in the workplace today, the concept of what it means to be a manager is changing. And it’s not getting any easier. The workplace has become a complex environment that includes faster and faster communication, swiftly changing economic circumstances, remote workers (sometimes on another continent), and data spitting in all directions. The workforce has changed: It’s younger, more technologically savvy, and more diverse in every way.

  A manager is responsible for directing a group of employees or a project. This sounds pretty simple, but it’s really not. The Wall Street Journal cites management guru, the late Peter Drucker, to this effect: A manager sets objectives; organizes; motivates and communicates; measures; and develops people. “While other management experts may use different words and focus on different aspects of these responsibilities,” says the Journal’s writer, “Mr. Drucker’s basic description of the manager’s job still holds.” At its heart, good management is all about teamwork.
  
  You’ll be judged as a manager, to a great extent, by how your team functions and the outcome of your project.

# The Flavors of Organisation

- Look up the word manager on the Internet or in any reference book and you will find many different definitions. They range from the coach of a sporting team to an individual hired to manage a celebrity’s business or personal affairs to a computer server that provides the communication link between the systems administrator and affiliated devices on a network. But the most common definition is of someone responsible for directing or organizing a group of employees or a project

  Managers of various organizations and companies come in many “flavors”—they can be directors, group or section leaders, various vice presidents, chief operating officers, even heads of boards of directors. In the truest sense, even the president of the United States is a manager.
  
  According to management expert Bill Warner, despite their varying responsibilities all managers have several things in common: They are leaders, project managers, and coaches who use department resources—both people and equipment—to get the job done. They develop strategies, organize the department, set priorities and make decisions, place and ensure the training of their workers, delegate responsibilities, find solutions, make sure employees have adequate resources to do the job, communicate with department and outside sources, and represent (both internally and externally) and help determine company policy.
  
- `The Function of Management: The 80:20 Rule` -- The 80:20 rule states that you will often find an (approximately) 80:20 ratio between related factors. For example:
  - 80 percent of the sales revenue derives from 20 percent of the customers. 80
  - percent of the problems are caused by 20 percent of the people.
  - 80 percent of the results come from 20 percent of the activities.
  
  With this in mind, you can begin to understand the importance of focusing on the 20 percent that needs to be attended to at any given moment. Focusing on the 20 percent allows managers to prioritize how they spend their time. Because new managers often lack experience, they typically find that their schedule fills up quickly because they try to do everything. Prioritizing enables the manager to have an impact without spending sixty hours a week in the office.
  
  The 80:20 rule enables you to weed out the problems and concentrate on the areas that need improvement. It will also help you identify strengths within your organization, as well as benchmark high achievers.
  
- `From “Being Managed” to Manager` -- So how do you make the transition from a good worker who produced solid results— resulting in your promotion—to managing others and achieving the same (or greater) level of success

  The first step is managing yourself. This includes obvious areas like staying in shape, eating and sleeping well; being accountable for your actions As a manager, you’ll be leading by example, and you will set the tone for your entire department. Your responsibilities include. motivating your team members to do the best work possible and shaping the team into a cohesive unit that gets the job done. So you’ll want to set a standard for personal excellence
  
   The latter is especially important in obtaining cooperation from employees, who must feel that you are loyal and that they can trust you. They also need to be comfortable coming to you with their ideas and sense that you will act upon their feedback and suggestions.
  
  > “In most cases being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way.”
    ―Tina Fey, Bossypants
    
  Employees will do their best when working for someone who they believe in and can turn to. They also expect you to be more than competent in, if not on the cutting edge of, your area of expertise.

# Understanding the Corporate Culture: How Things Are Done
  
- Corporate culture is often defined as “how we do things around here,” and it reflects the organization’s personality, attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and values If you’re going to be a successful manager, it’s essential that you understand the culture of your workplace and act according to it rather than against it.

  Theories abound that explain corporate culture. Among the most insightful and commonly used is a model from MIT professor Ed Schein, who describes it as existing on three cognitive levels. At the first or “surface” level are the attributes that can be seen by the outside observer—physical layout, dress code, how employees interact with each other, the company’s policies and procedures, and organizational structure. The next “middle” level consists of the professed culture of the company: its mission statements, slogans, and stated values. At the third and deepest level are the organization’s tacit assumptions, the “unspoken rules” that are rarely consciously acknowledged even by the employees. Here you’ll find taboo and sometimes contradictory elements of company culture
  
  Not only must managers understand all three levels of a culture, but they must also know how to navigate the complex and often-conflicting third level, a task that requires the utmost tact and sensitivity. It is in this third level that managers face their greatest challenge
  
  The best way to prevent inadvertent slip-ups is to find a peer or manager who can help you understand the more subtle nuances of accepted practices.
