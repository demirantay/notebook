## Financial Independence

- It is typically defined as having enough income (from investments, passive businesses, real estate, etc) to pay for your reasonable living expenses for the rest of your life. You have the freedom to do what you want with your time (within reason). Working (full or part time), hobbies which generate income, or other activities are optional at this point.

- The three keys are: 1-Reducing expenses, 2-Increasing income, 3-Investings. As the famous saying you cant get rich by spedning less or generating more ... you have to invest!
  - `Reducing Expenses` : Reducing your living expenses to a reasonable level is the most critical step. Five-star restaurants, vacation homes, and jets are generally not achievable as a reasonable financial independence goal. But if you can realize contentment with significantly lower expenses, your ability to reach financial independence is greatly improved.
  - `Increasing Income` : There are choices each of us can make to increase our ability to generate income. Improve your education, ask for a raise, create a side business. .. etc.
  - `Investing` : When you're heading towards financial independence, you need your money to work for you. Real estate, investing. While we don't focus on specific strategies we're interested in long term sustainable investment returns. Money in a savings account won't grow at the necessary rate.
  
- Be careful about theese: 1) Try to buy at least one house in the city you work and from that point avoid changing your base (this may be one of your first invesment). 2) Many marrigaes end in divorce and it is expensive! there are law fees, child care, alimony, .. etc. avoid this at all cost. 3) Any loans are barrowing money from future you, we are all millonares at the end, weather you see it in your bank account is insignifiacnt even if you work with minimum wage you will earn a million in 40 years so spend wisely from now. Loans for depreciating assets (cars, electronics, etc) in particular are generally bad ideas.
