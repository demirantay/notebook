# SUPPLY AND DEMAND: CONSUMER BEHAVIOR

- Economists are always making assumptions about people’s behavior. One assumption that seems to make sense is that people try to make themselves as happy as possible. In economics-speak, this is called utility maximization. When consumers buy goods and services, they are doing so to maximize their utility.

  When it comes to consumer behavior, economists argue that consumers seek to maximize their utility subject to their budget constraint 
  
  Each time you benefit from consuming a piece, economists say that you are experiencing marginal utility, but you do not care what economists say because you are eating candy and getting fat and happy. You might describe the feeling you are having as getting happy points.
The more candy you eat, the more happy points you get. You are maximizing your utility.
If you have ever overindulged on candy, cookies, brownies, or ice cream, you know that at first the eating was enjoyable, but after a few (or a dozen), you were not quite as happy as when you started. Economists refer to this phenomenon as diminishing marginal utility. In other words, each piece of candy you eat gives you fewer happy points than the prior piece. Diminishing marginal utility is a useful concept. If exercising for one hour is good for your health, then why not exercise for twenty-four straight hours? Again, the answer is: diminishing marginal utility

- `Demand` -- If you have ever witnessed an auction, then you might have noticed that there are many more low bids for an item than high bids. That is, people are more willing and able to pay a low price for an item than to pay a high price. This willingness and ability to buy something is referred to as demand. The fact that more people are willing to buy at lower prices than at higher prices is called the law of demand. Three reasons explain why the law of demand exists:
  - diminishing marginal utility
  - income effect 
  - subsitution effect
  
- `Diminisinhg Marginal Utility` -- The reason that diminishing marginal utility is an explanation of the law of demand is easy to understand. As you consume more and more of an item, each successive unit provides less utility, or happy points, than the previous unit. As a result, the only way that you will buy more of an item is if the price is lower

  Income effect is based on your budget constraint. As the price of a good drops, your purchasing power increases. As the price increases, your purchasing power falls. Income effect explains the logic behind discounts and sale prices. When goods go on sale at a lower price, your limited income is able to purchase more, so that is what you do.
  
- `Substition Effect` -- Substitution effect is another explanation for the law of demand. The substitution effect says that you substitute relatively less expensive items for relatively more expensive items.

- `Elacticty of Demand` -- Think about all of the things that you buy in a year. You might purchase goods and services as diverse as chewing gum, emergency room visits, and cars. Sometimes you are very sensitive to the price and at other times you are not. For example, you’re more likely to shop around for a good price on a car than on an emergency room visit. Economists refer to this sensitivity to price as elasticity of demand.

  Compare an emergency appendectomy with a facelift. Both are surgeries, but consumer demand for these surgeries is quite different. Acute appendicitis does not wait for you to shop for the best price on surgery. Price is probably the last thing on your mind when experiencing this illness. Your demand for the surgery is inelastic. Facelifts are an entirely different matter. First, the purchase can be delayed. Next, a facelift has available substitutes, like Botox and collagen injection. Finally, because facelifts are optional and not covered by most health insurance plans, they tend to take a large percentage of a person’s income. The result of this combination of factors is that, for most, facelift demand is elastic.

# SUPPLY AND DEMAND: A PRICE IS BORN

- Consumers demand, producers supply. Supply reflects producers’ changing willingness and ability to make or sell at the various prices that occur in the marke

  The law of supply states that producers are able and willing to sell more as the price increases. The reason for the law of supply is the simple fact that as production increases, so do the marginal costs. As rational, self-interested individuals, suppliers are only willing to produce if they are able to cover their cost.
  
- `Elacticty of Supply` -- Elasticity of supply is the producers’ sensitivity to changes in price on the quantity they are willing to produce. The key factor in supply elasticity is the amount of time it takes to produce the good or service. If producers can respond to price changes rapidly, supply is relatively elastic. However, if producers need considerable time to respond to changes in the market price of their product, supply is relatively inelastic. Compare corn tortillas and wine. Corn tortillas are easily produced with readily available materials. If the market price of corn tortillas were to suddenly increase, producers would have little difficulty in producing more tortillas in response to the price change. Now, if the market price of Pinot Noir were to suddenly increase, winemakers would have much more difficulty responding to the price change. Vines take years to develop, grapes take time to ripen, and wine needs time to age. All of these factors give wine a relatively inelastic supply

- `A price is born` -- When supply meets demand, something interesting happens. A price is born. In an efficient market, prices are a function of the supply and demand for the good or service. The pitting of consumers trying to maximize their utility against producers trying to maximize their profits is what determines the price of goods in the market and also the quantity that is bought and sold. Prices are efficient because they are understood by most participants in the market. If you give a child $5 and send her into a candy shop, she could figure out what she can afford without having to ask anyone for help. A price conveys much information. The price of a good communicates to consumers whether or not to purchase and to the producer whether or not to produce it. Prices are fair because they are neutral; they favor neither buyer nor seller.

- `Finding Equiblirum` -- A market is said to be in equilibrium when at the prevailing price there is neither a surplus nor shortage of the good or service. When this condition is present, then the price is called the equilibrium or market- clearing price. Market equilibrium is the most desirable outcome because it allows for consumers to maximize utility while also allowing producers to maximize profits

  There are times when the market is not in equilibrium. Sometimes, the market price is greater than the equilibrium price.
When this happens, a surplus results.

# CHANGES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND

- Change in either demand or supply will cause change in both price and quantity. As price changes, producers are willing to produce more or less. Price affects the quantity producers supply, but it does not affect supply.
  
  Understand that supply refers to producers’ willingness to produce various amounts at various prices, and not to some fixed quantity
  
- `What causes supply to change` -- Supply is influenced by nature, the price of inputs, competition, expected prices, related profits, and government.
  - Nature plays a big part in determining the supply of coffee. Rain, sunshine, temperature, and disease are obvious examples of variables in nature that will affect the coffee harvest
  - nput or resource prices have a direct influence on producers’ supply decisions. Land, seed, fertilizer, pesticide, harvesting equipment, labor, and storage are just a few of the costs that coffee producers face
  - The presence of more or less competition causes increases or decreases in supply. As the popularity of coffee has risen, more and more producers have entered the marke
  - Expectations of future price increases tend to decrease supply, but expectations of future price decreases have the opposite effect. If producers expect higher prices in the future, they will be less willing to supply in the present. Coffee producers might withhold production in order to sell when prices are higher
  - The profitability of related goods and services also affects the supply of a good like coffee. For example, coffee-growing land is also favorable for growing cocoa.Government policies can also affect supply. Government can tax, subsidize, or regulate production, and this will affect supply
  - Technology and the availability of physical capital are key determinants of supply. Increases in the amount of physical capital available relative to labor also help firms to increase output. Economists refer to this phenomenon as capital deepening. As capital deepening increases for a firm, so does supply
  
> Capital in economics does not refer to money, but to all of the tools, factories, and equipment used in the production process. Capital is the product of investment.

- `What casues changes in demand` -- Consumer tast . Advertising can affect the taste for goods and services as well.es for goods and services are subject to change and when these changes happen, demand shift

> Cross Price Elacticity: Determining whether goods are substitutes or complements is not a matter of opinion. Economists calculate cross-price elasticity to determine whether goods are complements or substitutes by dividing the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good by the percentage change in the price of another good. If cross-price elasticity is less than zero, goods are complements, and if cross-price elasticity is greater than zero, goods are substitutes.

- `Normal and Iferior Goods` -- Changes in consumers’ income will lead to changes in demand. If income and demand move in the same direction, you are dealing with a normal good. If income and demand move in opposite directions, the good is considered inferior

# The Production Function

- Both microeconomics and macroeconomics make distinctions between production decisions in the short run and production decisions in the long run.

- `The long and short of it` -- The short run is defined as the period of time in which firms are able to vary only one of the inputs to production, usually labor. The long run is the period in which firms are able to vary all the inputs in the production process.
If you operate a restaurant, in the short run (today and next week) you can only add or subtract workers to adjust the level of production. If your place is busy, you schedule or call up more of your workers. If business is slow, you send the employees home. The long run is the period in which you are able to expand the kitchen or add new equipment. So in response to an increase in business activity, in the short run you can schedule more workers, but in the long run you can make the restaurant bigger.

# Controlling Costs

- Businesses or firms strive to earn the most profits possible. Call that the Law of Gordon “Greed Is Good” Gekko. Businesses try to increase profitability by trying to increase revenue and decrease cost. In a competitive environment, firms can’t do much to increase revenue. If Target is selling Beautiful Brand toilet paper for $1 per four-pack, Walmart is also going to have to sell Beautiful Brand toilet paper for about $1 per four-pack. They lack pricing power. Firms do, however, have the ability to control costs, so in order to maximize their profits they try to produce at the lowest cost possible.

- `Types of Costs` -- Economists break down costs into different categories:
  - The first category of costs is fixed costs or overhead. A firm’s fixed costs are those costs that don’t change regardless of the level of production. Rent, property tax, management salaries, and depreciation are examples. Whether a factory is running at full capacity or is idle, the overhead remains the same
  -  Firms also face variable costs. Variable costs change with the level of a firm’s output. Utilities, hourly wages, and per-unit taxes are representative of variable costs. As a firm’s production
  - Total cost is the sum of a firm’s fixed and variable costs.

# PERFECT COMPETITION IN THE SHORT RUN

- Perfect competition is the kind of hypothetical situation that economists love to talk about even though it exists in the same fairy-tale realm as unicorns and sea dragons. Perfect competition is the made-up idea that businesses will behave in certain ways if we stipulate that all of the businesses in a particular industry are playing on a level field. The theory of perfect competition allows economists to describe what would happen if only people would listen to them.

- `Perfect competition in four easy pieces` -- 
  - Consumers and producers have perfect knowledge—they know all there is to know about the product and the market—and they make rational decisions. That means consumers are trying to maximize utility (i.e., happy points) and producers are trying to maximize profit, and both groups have all the information they need to be able to do these things.
  - Businesses can enter and exit the market without barriers. Here we pretend that businesses don’t have to beg venture capitalists for start-up funds or hold going-out-of-business sales.
  - All producers make things (“outputs” or finished goods) that are identical and all of them have inputs (e.g., labor) that are the same. In Perfect Competition World, a pair of Keds and a pair of Dolce & Gabbana shoes are exactly equivalent and require exactly the same resources to produce.
  - Lots of producers are competing in the same area, meaning that no producer (business) has pricing power—none is big enough or monopolistic enough to manage it. Everyone prices their goods in relationship to everyone else

# Perfect Competition in the Long Run

- Perfect competition does not really exist. It is unlikely that you will find an industry in which all of the conditions for perfect competition are met. However, perfect competition provides an example with which to compare the market structures that do exist. Although it isn’t real, it provides a nice frame of reference.
  
- `Monopolies and Profit` -- Economists classify markets according to their level of competition. On one end of the spectrum lie perfectly competitive, albeit fictional, markets. On the other end of the continuum lies monopoly. In between you will find the market structures that are most familiar, monopolistic competition and oligopoly.

- `Monopolistic Competition` -- Monopolistic competition is a market structure very similar to perfect competition. There are many buyers and sellers, barriers to entry are minimal or at least equal for all firms, and information is readily available. However, in monopolistic competition, firms do not offer identical products, but differentiate their products from those of their competition. Product differentiation is the process by which producers are able to convince consumers that their particular product is different from other producers’ products.

  The industry that should come to mind when you think of monopolistic competition is fast food. The fast-food industry has many different producers competing for the dollars of many different consumers. All are welcome to start a fast-food restaurant as long as they pay the required licenses. Most producers have a good idea of what they are getting into and customers tend to understand the products quite well. Why is fast food monopolistically competitive? Product differentiation. Each firm offers a different menu.
Taco Bell, Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Subway all compete against each other in the fast-food market while providing customers with a variety of choices. Product differentiation is one of the reasons that new entrants are able to survive in this cutthroat industry. If you are different enough, then you might have a chance.


  The problem with product differentiation is that it becomes a never-ending process. Firms must continually find ways to differentiate. This explains why firms will spend large sums of money on advertising. Much of the advertising is not so much an attempt to gain new customers as it is an effort to build brand loyalty. However, firms have limited resources, so engaging in product differentiation through advertising means that resources used in advertising are no longer available for production. As a result, industries that are monopolistically competitive do not produce as much output as they could if they were perfectly competitive. Consumers are missing out on what could have been. Not to worry, it seems that consumers have a strong preference for the variety that monopolistic competition brings, and so the benefits may at least equal the costs
