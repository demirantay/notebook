# FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND EXCHANGE RATES

- What determines the price of apples? If you answered supply and demand, then you would be correct. What determines the foreign exchange price of a dollar? Once again, if you said supply and demand, then you are right on target. Whenever one currency is exchanged for another, foreign exchange has occurred and an exchange rate has been paid. The exchange rate is nothing more than the current price of a currency in terms of another currency. Exchange rates are determined in the world’s largest market, the foreign exchange market

  The foreign exchange market is dominated by the British, Americans, and Japanese with the vast majority of trades occurring in the U.S. dollar. The euro (€), pound sterling (£), Japanese yen (¥), and Swiss franc (SFr) are the other hard currencies most often traded. Who’s involved:
   - Large banks are the main players in the foreign exchange market, brought together through a system of interconnected brokers. The banks serve both corporate and individual customers who need foreign exchange in order to conduct business.
   - Central banks also participate in the foreign exchange market in order to either manipulate exchange rates or to correct imbalances between their country’s current and financial accounts.
   - Finally, speculators looking to profit from arbitrage opportunities also participate in this immense market.
   
   Changes in exchange rates can wreak havoc on businesses and entire economies. Economists and policymakers must therefore consider the implications of their actions on exchange rates. Tastes, interest rates, inflation, relative income, and speculation affect exchange rates and thus economies as a whole.

- `Taste and Preference` -- The popularity of cars and consumer electronics from South Korea among American consumers necessarily creates a demand for South Korea’s currency, the won (W)Over time, appreciation of a country’s currency may reduce the popularity of its products as they become relatively more expensive. Given that people often prefer relatively cheaper goods

- `Interest rate and inflation` -- Changes in real interest rates also affect the foreign exchange market. Unlike trade flows, which tend to be rather stable, changing interest rates can cause sudden fluctuations in exchange rates. Savers are attracted to high interest rates, so when one country’s real interest rate rises relative to another country, savings flow toward the higher interest rate

  The presence of inflation in an economy provides an incentive for its people to exchange their currency for one that is more stable. Zimbabwe’s inflation has reduced the value of its currency to the point where a sheet of paper is more valuable than a single unit of its currency. The result of inflation is to not only reduce the value of the currency domestically but also in foreign exchange.

  Banks, companies, and individuals attempting to profit from foreign exchange will speculate in the market. For example, a speculator may suspect that European interest rates will rise faster than American interest rates, so she will purchase euros and hold them until they have appreciated enough to show a profit. For most people, however, speculating in foreign exchange is about as profitable as playing craps in Las Vegas.

# Exports and Balance of Trade 

- `Balance of Trade` --  Net exports, or the balance of trade, is equal to the value of all exports minus the value of all imports. Net exports in the United States are negative because the value of imports exceeds the value of exports. This is referred to as a balance of trade deficit.
Other countries like China, Germany, and Japan have balance of trade surpluses because the value of their exports exceeds that of their imports. Surprisingly, even though the United States has a balance of trade deficit, it is still the world’s largest exporter with 12% of the global share

- `Net Transfers` -- Other actions besides trade require foreign exchange. Transfer payments, called remittances, and foreign aid create outflows of currency from rich countries to poor countries in foreign exchange markets

- `Net Foreign Invesment` -- Unlike net exports, net foreign factor income, and net transfers, which involve one-time exchanges, net foreign investment creates recurring payments and income. When citizens of one country purchase the real or financial assets of another country, it is classified as net foreign investment. 

  Foreign investment is an important source of savings for the host country. These savings can be used to invest in physical capital and expand a country’s economy
  
  Foreign investment is not without its downside. Just as easily as savings can flow into a country through portfolio investment, the savings can flow out. A sudden outflow of savings may precipitate a currency crisis, inflation, and high interest rates for the affected country

# Official Reserves and Exchange Rate Policy

- In addition to foreign investment, the financial account of the balance of payments includes official reserves. Central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve System, maintain reserves of foreign currency or official reserves. The purpose of official reserves is to provide a stabilizing influence in the foreign exchange market. If a balance of payments deficit occurs, the Federal Reserve reduces its foreign reserves in order to zero out the balance. In the case of a balance of payments surplus, the Federal Reserve acquires additional foreign reserves to zero out the balance.

  Today many approaches to exchange rates exist. Some countries let their currency float, others peg their currency to the dollar, and still others have unified under a single currency.
  
  The United States and United Kingdom allow their respective currencies to float on the foreign exchange market, which means that they do not use official reserves to maintain exchange rates.
The benefit of this system is that it gives policymakers the ability to practice interest rate policies to encourage domestic growth or slow inflation without having to consider exchange rates.

  The turn of this century saw another approach to exchange rate policy. Europe unified its economy under a single currency, the euro. France and Germany, for example, can now trade freely without regard to exchange rates. The advent of the euro created the world’s second largest currency after the dollar. For all of its benefits, the euro suffers a major drawback—individual countries can’t manage it.
  
  In 2010, Greece suffered a severe financial blow when its sovereign debt’s credit rating was reduced. Unable to implement independent monetary policy, the Greeks have been forced to reduce their spending and raise taxes or risk default. The EU’s reaction to this crisis will either weaken or bolster the euro’s chances of becoming the dominant world currency.

# THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR

- `The private sector` -- The starting point for understanding the entire economy is a very simple model that illustrates how households and firms interact in the product market and the factor market. The private sector is nothing more than the households and businesses in an economy. Households buy goods and services from firms in the product market.

- `Factor market` -- Where did the households get the money to buy the goods and services?
  - Households sell their labor and entrepreneurship to the firms (via the factor market) in exchange for wages and profits.
  - Households also sell natural resources to the firms in exchange for rents.
  - If you work for someone else, you are selling your labor in the factor market so that you can get the goods and services you want and need in the product market.
  - As a business owner or entrepreneur, you sell your entrepreneurial ability in exchange for profits from the firm.
  
- `The Public Sector` -- Notice that the simple model of the private sector overlooks everything the government does. So we have to consider the public sector of the economy as well as the private sector. The public sector refers to all levels of government, from local to federal. The public sector interacts with households by purchasing some of the factors of production (such as land or labor) in exchange for the factor payments (such as wage, rent, or interest). Government also interacts with firms by buying goods and services in the product market.
Government combines the factors of production with the goods and services it buys from firms in order to provide public goods and services to the private sector. National defense, police, fire protection, schools, libraries, and roads are examples of the types of public goods and services provided by the public sector.

# THE FOREIGN SECTOR

- The U.S. economy interacts with the rest of the world in both the product and factor markets (not to mention the financial markets, discussed later in the book). The circular flow theory accounts for the interaction of markets throughout this larger world economy, not just domestically.

- `Import and export` -- In the product market, not all goods and services flow to the domestic government and domestic households. Some of the domestically produced goods and services are exported to people in other countries. In the same manner, not all of the goods and services that are purchased by households and government are domestically produced.

- `Foreign factor payments and income` -- Not only do Americans trade goods and services with the rest of the world in the product market, they also trade the factors of production with the rest of the world. Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship flow from the rest of the world in exchange for foreign factor payments

- `Foreign transfers` -- A considerable amount of money is transferred to other countries not in payment for goods and services but to help support family members. This type of transfer, called a remittance, affects the economy but does not constitute a direct exchange in a market. India is a prime example of a country dependent upon a large expatriate community. Many Indians living abroad remit money to their extended families back in India. Likewise, Mexico is heavily dependent upon remittances from emigrants working in the United States.

- `the extent of remittances` -- Remittances are the second largest source of income for Mexico after oil exports. As of 2006, Mexico and India received annual remittances of $25 billion each, much of which originated from the United States.

# THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND FINANCIAL MARKETS

- So far in our discussion of the circular flow theory, financial intermediaries have been left out of the picture, literally. The financial sector, or intermediaries like banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and stock exchanges, help to facilitate all of the transactions that have been mentioned in this discussion. The importance of financial intermediaries cannot be underestimated. They stand in the middle of almost all transactions. Without them, most modern markets would be unable to function. They are the grease that makes the wheels turn smoothly, the key that unlocks the door, the wind beneath your wings.

- Most of the transactions that are conducted in the product market either involve the use of checks, debit cards, credit cards, cash drawn from ATMs (rather than from under your mattress), or in the case of exports and imports, foreign exchange. All of these services are provided by the financial intermediaries but of course not out of the goodness of their hearts. Rather, like any business, they are motivated by the potential of profit, so they charge a fee for their services.

  It’s fairly obvious how financial intermediaries such as banks are involved in product markets—just a little observation of your own habits will demonstrate. It’s kind of hard to give Amazon.com that $20 bill in your wallet, but it’s a piece of cake to give them your credit card number
  
- `The financial markets` -- Up to this point, all of the income that has been earned by households, firms, government, and the rest of the world has been spent in the circular flow model. Dollar in = dollar out. But private, public, and foreign sectors don’t only spend money—they also save it.
  
   Households save for the future, government can run a budget surplus, businesses retain earnings for future investment, and the foreign sector engages in real and portfolio investment in the United States. Where do all of these savings go? Savings flow to financial intermediaries and from there (in the form of loans) to all sectors of the economy:
   - When households save, they may buy shares of stock, bonds, or certificates of deposit. Government finances its spending in excess of taxes by issuing the various Treasury securities.
