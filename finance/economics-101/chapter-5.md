# OLIGOPOLIES AND IMPERFECTLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS

- Many of the companies with which you are most familiar do not exist in perfectly competitive markets or even in highly competitive markets. The major automobile manufacturers, airlines, telecommunications companies, food producers, and discount retailers compete in an oligopolistic market structure—that is, a market with few producers.
  
  At a local level, many of the utilities you use are monopolies. Oligopoly and monopoly are common market structures in the United States. In the last section, we briefly described monopolies. Now, let’s look at oligopolies. To know how the American economy works, you need a good understanding of these imperfectly competitive market structures.
  
- `oligopoly` -- Oligopoly describes a market where a few large producers dominate. Unlike competitive and monopolistically competitive markets, oligopolistic firms have more pricing power. In addition, oligopoly is characterized by considerable barriers to entry because of the sheer scale of the firms. Oligopoly is often the result of once-competitive markets maturing. As monopolistically competitive firms grow and merge with other firms, fewer firms result. 

- `Loss of Competition` -- Why does it matter if firms consolidate, industries mature, and markets become oligopolistic? As competition decreases, a number of negative effects occur. Prices become higher, and productive and allocative efficiency, which benefit society, are lost. Notice how these are industries where consumers tend to dislike the producers. (Has anyone ever actually loved an airline the way they love a chocolate- chip cookie?) An interesting coincidence, wouldn’t you say?

  To determine whether a market meets the condition of oligopoly, economists calculate the Herfindahl- Hirschman Index (HHI) for the market. A relatively low index number identifies a market as competitive, and a relatively high index number indicates oligopoly. 
  
  he oligopolists have an interdependent relationship with each other. Because the oligopolists control so much market share, their individual decisions have considerable impacts on market prices. Knowing this to be the case, the oligopolist tends to be more aware of the competition and takes this into account when making production and pricing decisions.
  
- `Collusion` -- Collusion means any type of illegal conspiracy. For economists, collusion also implies an intent to cheat or defraud consumers (and others) by artificially reducing competition.
  
- `What defines an Indsutry` -- What defines an industry for the purpose of determining concentration ratios? It depends. Today the definition of industry is becoming blurred. In the past, the newspaper industry was an industry. Today it is part of a larger industry known as the media. Even though the local paper may have 100% of the local newspaper market share, other forms of media reduce its effective share in the overall industry.

# Collusions and Cartels

- Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, warned that nothing beneficial comes from the heads of business getting together, and history has proven him right

- `Collusion` -- In the United States, firms are forbidden from cooperating to set prices or production. Even though it violates the law, businesses from time to time will collude in order to set prices.
Colluding firms can divide up the market in a way that is beneficial for them. The firms avoid competition, set higher prices, and reduce their operating costs. Because collusion is illegal and punishable by fine and prison, executives at firms are reluctant to engage in the practice. The meetings of business leaders are almost always in the presence of attorneys in order to avoid the accusation of collusion.


- `Fomring Cartels` -- Businesses that collude may form cartels. A cartel is a group of businesses that effectively function as a single producer or monopoly able to charge whatever price the market will bear. Probably the best- known modern cartel is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC

  OPEC seeks to maintain high oil prices and profits for their members by restricting output. Each member of the cartel agrees to a production quota that will eventually reduce overall output and increase prices. OPEC is bad news for anyone who enjoys cheap gasoline
  
  Cartels go through periods of cooperation and competition. When prices and profits are low, the members of the cartel have an incentive to cooperate and limit production. It is the cartel’s success that brings the incentive to cheat

# Game Theroy

- Economists have discovered that game theory is useful for understanding the behavior of oligopolists. Game theory looks at the outcomes of decisions made when those decisions depend upon the choices of others. Game theory is a study of interdependent decision-making.

- `Game Theory in Business` -- Some business decisions follow the same logic. Assume in an isolated small town there are only two gas stations and they are out of direct sight from each other. By law they are only allowed to change their price once a day. Each firm has two pricing options available to them. They can charge a high price or a low price. From past experience they know that when they both charge a high price, they both profit by
$1,000. When one charges a high price and the other a low price, then the high-priced station earns $300 in profits while the low-priced station earns $1,200. When they both charge a low price, then profits are
$750 for each. If given the chance to collude, which strategy would they both take? Given collusion, both would agree to set a high price for gas and each would earn daily profits of $1,000. What should the gas stations do if they are unable to collude? The thinking goes like this: “If I charge a high price, I’ll either earn $1,000 or
$300. If I charge a low price, I’ll either earn $1200 or $750.” Because the firms are out of sight from each other and have no legal way to know the other’s pricing strategy, then their best course of action or dominant strategy is to set a low price, which guarantees at least $750 in profits and as much as $1200.
Just like in the prisoner’s dilemma, when the players do not have the ability to collude, they select a strategy that results in an outcome that is not necessarily the one that maximizes profits.
Unlike the prisoner’s dilemma, which is a one-time game, firms compete against each other day after day. Given the chance to play the “game” over and over results in something called tacit collusion. By playing a game of tit for tat, the firms can eventually reach a point where they both charge a high price and maximize their profits. How does it work?
  - 1 -  Assume that on the first day, both gas stations charge a high price. Both earn profits of $1,000.
  - 2 -On the second day, one of the stations charges a high price, but the other cheats and charges a low
price to earn profits of $1,200.

  - 3 - Predictably, the next day the other station retaliates and lowers its price, resulting in profits of $750 for each.
  - 4 - Eventually both gas stations come to the realization that if they both set a high price and do not cheat, they both will earn higher profits in the long run. They learn that if they cheat, their additional profit for the next day will not offset the lower profits that will ensue

# PRICING BEHAVIORS

- Businesses engage in many pricing (and non-price-related) competitions in order to increase their profits. The pricing behaviors they choose are related to the type of market they’re in, whether an oligopoly or a monopoly.

- `Pricing and Oligopolies` -- Interdependence leads oligopolists to behave strategically. The strategic pricing behaviors that occur in oligopoly include price leadership and price wars

- `Price Leadarship` -- Price leadership takes place when a dominant firm makes the pricing decision for the rest of the market. These decisions are often made public long before the new price goes into effect, and represent a form of tacit collusion. Smaller firms in the industry will usually follow suit and match the price leader’s price.
Price leadership offers firms an opportunity to capture a price that is higher than would occur if the firms directly competed on price

- `PRice wars` -- Price wars occur when firms break out of the price leadership model and begin undercutting one another’s prices. Although it sounds bad, price wars are often advantageous to consumers because of the competitive prices created in the process.

  A price war continues until the firms once again reach tacit collusion and return to the price leadership model.


- `Product Differentiation` -- While in the price leadership operating mode, firms compete on the basis of product differentiation as opposed to price. By emphasizing their product’s differences and uniqueness, firms attempt to wrest market share from one another. As in the monopolistically competitive market, oligopolists engaging in non-price competition will spend large sums on advertising. For example, the major American beer brands do not compete on price, but instead rely on non-price competition in the form of advertising in order to gain market share from one another.

- `Pricing and Monopolies` -- n the opposite end of the spectrum from perfect competition lies monopoly. As the name suggests, monopoly is a market dominated by a single seller. In the United States, monopolies are generally not allowed to exist, and every effort is made by government regulators at the FTC to prevent their creation. Despite the fact that monopolies are undesirable, there are several good reasons for some to exist.

- `Price INcreases` -- Monopoly occurs when a competitive firm eliminates all competition. Through control of key resources, mergers, and even a little help from government, once-competitive firms may find themselves in the enviable position of being a monopolist. A typical pricing behavior for a monopoly is to increase prices as much as possible.

  John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust is probably the most notable American monopoly. By controlling the resource, purchasing the competition, and having political influence, Standard Oil at its height of power virtually controlled all oil production in the United States. This was good for Mr.
Rockefeller as it made him the world’s wealthiest man, but for consumers and possible competitors, the results of the Standard Oil Trust were high prices, inefficient production, and significant barriers to entry. Eventually, the Sherman Antitrust Act was used to break up Standard Oil, and ever since the government has taken an active role in preventing further monopolies.

- `Price Discrimination` -- Because they lack competition, monopolies can engage in price discrimination to make it difficult for other firms to do business. Price discrimination is the ability to charge different customers different prices for the same good or service Today, thanks to the Clayton Antitrust Act, price discrimination for the most part is illegal.

  Some forms of price discrimination still exist because they are seen as acceptable.
You might have benefited from price discrimination the last time you went to a movie theater or flew on an airplane. Senior citizen, student, and military discounts are usually offered at theaters. Business travelers and vacationers often pay very different prices for tickets on the same flight even though they might both fly coach. How do the airlines get away with it? It is defensible because vacationers and business travelers have different elasticities of demand for airline ticket

# MONOPOLY: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY

- Monopoly isn’t always a bad thing. Then again, it isn’t always a good thing. When monopoly is allowed to exist, it is for a good reason

- `The Good` -- Good monopolies come in several forms depending on the type of output (good/item/service) being produced

- `Natural Monopoly` -- The first is natural monopoly.A commonly cited example of natural monopoly is your local electrical utility. A feature of power plants that encourages natural monopoly is that as the size of a power plant increases, the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity falls. You might own a small electrical generator. Imagine the cost of operating the generator or multiple small generators just to meet your home’s electrical needs. Now imagine the cost of every household in a city running on multiple portable generators. The total fixed cost of generators for the community would be quite high, and the variable cost of running gas or diesel generators would be astronomical.

  Compare that situation with the one that most likely exists in your city. Instead of multitudes of portable generators, a few large coal-fired power plants are able to generate electricity for the entire city at a much lower total cost. Remember that utilities are monopolies. What keeps the utility from charging a monopoly price for electricity? Government regulates the prices that utilities are able to charge their customers for electricity. By controlling prices, government encourages low-cost production while allowing the utility to experience an accounting profit on production
  
- `Techonological Monoploy` -- The technological monopoly is another form of monopoly that is encouraged. When a firm invents a new product or process and receives patent protection, the firm becomes a technological monopolist for that particular product. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patent protection lasts for twenty years from the date on which it was originally applied. During that period of time, no other firm may develop or import the technology.

  During the period of patent protection, the patent holder as a monopolist can charge a monopoly price and earn economic profits. If monopoly prices are higher than competitive prices, why is this encouraged? Patent protection encourages innovation, invention, and research and development. Without the protection, firms would have little incentive to invest billions of dollars in research knowing the firm next door could just copy the product without having made the investment and profit nonetheless. It is because of patent protection and the ability to earn monopoly profits that American and European pharmaceutical companies develop so many life-saving medications. Without patent protection, there would be little incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to pursue its research
  
- `The Bad` -- At times government may decide to step into the marketplace in order to provide a good or service. An example of government monopoly is the U.S. Postal Service The arguments for and against government monopolies fall mainly on philosophical grounds conservatives and libertarians are opposed to government performing the functions of private enterprise on the grounds that government is wasteful and inefficient

- `The Ugly` -- Pure, unregulated monopoly is ugly. A firm that is the sole provider of a good or service is able to prevent competition. It can charge whatever price the consumer will pay. Although one may say “to the victor go the spoils Competition benefits society by providing a variety of goods and services at competitive prices that accurately reflect the costs of production. Pure monopoly is the opposite of this condition. Pure monopoly is one good at a price that in no way reflects the true cost of production.
  
  The diamond monopoly of De Beers is the classic example of monopoly gone bad. De Beers at the height of its power dictated the diamond industry. By controlling the resource and coercing the wholesalers and cutters to abide by its demands, De Beers created an illusion of scarcity and value in the diamond market that allowed it to earn economic profits for over 100 year

# GOVERNMENT IN THE MARKETPLACE: PRICE CEILINGS AND PRICE FLOORS

- From time to time, people will petition government to step in and correct perceived wrongs in the market. Often this leads to unexpected results. Without considering how people might respond to incentives, well- intentioned policies can go astray Two approaches governments use are price ceilings and price floors.

- `Price Ceilings` -- In the early 1970s, America was faced with ever-increasing food prices. As a result, people clamored for the government to step in and halt the increases. Instead of considering the source of the problem and doing something about that, government attempted to treat the symptoms

  price control was an effective price ceiling on food. Retailers could not charge a price higher than the government-mandated ceiling. A price ceiling is a legal maximum price for a good, service, or resource. At the time, the theory was that if the government imposed a price ceiling on food, prices would stop going up and everyone would have the food they wanted at the price they wanted

The law of demand, which governs consumer behavior, says that as prices fall, consumers have an incentive to buy more, and as prices rise, consumers have an incentive to buy less. The law of supply, which governs producer behavior, says that as prices rise, producers have an incentive to produce more, and as prices fall, producers have an incentive to produce less

  The result of the price ceiling is a shortage of meat at the price of $3 per pound. At that price, more meat is demanded than is supplied. Consumers got a price ceiling of $3, but many consumers did not get any meat at all.Eventually, America abandoned price controls, but it took a decade to get the underlying inflation under contro

- `Why Price Controls are inefficent` -- Price controls are inefficient for many reasons. One reason worth considering is that they increase the need for monitoring and enforcement. That means increased government bureaucracy, which does not come cheap. Increased government spending equals more taxes or more borrowing.

- `Price Floors` --  Politicians representing areas with large populations of unskilled labor are often pressured by voters to increase minimum wage. It’s believed that an increase in the minimum wage is justified because employers will pay the higher wage and maintain the same number of workers. However, that works only if you assume that people do not behave like people.

  In the end, the policy meant to help the poor helped those who maintained their jobs, but resulted in unemployment for those who were laid off and those who entered the job market looking for work
