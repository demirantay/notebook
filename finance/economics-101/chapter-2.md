# International Trade and Trade Barriers

“When trade is both voluntary and free, the buyer and the seller both benefit (if you buy a quart of milk, the dairy farmer gets money and you get milk without having to milk a cow). Because voluntary free trade is mutually beneficial, it creates wealth. Wealth is nothing more than the collective value of all you own. ”

- `International Trade` -- “When you trade with people in other countries, the same results of mutual benefit and wealth creation occur. Prior to World War II, trade agreements between nations were for the most part bilateral, that is, between the two parties, with special interests protected and trade barriers (such as taxes on imports and exports) common. The benefits of free trade were not realized, and nations drifted toward isolationism and protectionism.”

  “In 1947, many nations including the United States came together and formed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The goal of GATT was to reduce trade barriers so that member countries could equally enjoy the benefits of free trade.
The growth in international trade was accompanied by a rise in living standards among the members of the agreement. In 1995, the GATT became the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under “GATT and later the WTO, more and more countries have become supporters of fewer barriers to trade.”

- `The Case Against International Trade` -- “Despite its obvious benefits, free international trade has many detractors:”
  - “Environmentalists are concerned that as countries specialize, production will concentrate in countries that have fewer regulations to protect the environment from pollution and habitat destruction”
  - “Labor unions oppose free trade on the grounds that production will shift toward low-wage countries that have little or no union representation, and therefore negatively impact their membership”
  - “Human rights activists often oppose free trade as production shifts toward countries where working conditions are miserable and often inhumane, and where workers are not afforded the same rights and privileges as in industrialized nations.”
  - “Politicians and their constituents concerned with loss of national sovereignty often oppose free trade agreements on the grounds that decisions affecting the nation are being made by an international body not directly subject to the people.”

- ` A look at trade barriers` -- “At times a country might limit trade in order to punish another country. Tariffs, quotas, and embargoes are a few of the tools that a country will use in order to accomplish these other interests”

- `Tariffs` -- “A tariff is a tax on trade. Tariffs can be used to raise revenue for the government or in order to benefit a certain segment of the economy. You might pressure Congress to enact a tariff on imports if your industry is subject to foreign competition. For example, for years the U.S. steel industry was protected from cheap foreign competition by protective tariffs. In 2007, India proposed a tariff on rice exports in order to prevent food shortages. The Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 was intended to protect American industry and raise much-needed tax revenue for the government.
Tariffs are not without their downsides:”
  - “Protective tariffs often have the effect of preventing competition and encouraging waste and inefficiency.”
  - “Revenue tariffs often fail to raise tax revenue because people stop buying the now-expensive imports”
  - “Export tariffs might give producers an incentive not to produce”

- `Quotas` -- “Quotas are limits on trade. Instead of a tax on imports, you might use a quota to limit the number of imported goods coming into your country. In the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. automobile manufacturers and labor unions supported government quotas on foreign car imports to limit competition and preserve American jobs. The result was higher prices and lower quality”

  “Eventually, Japanese and German firms bypassed the quotas by establishing their factories in the United States. In the end, domestic producers faced more competition at home, and labor unions suffered as foreign firms established their factories in states where unions had less power.”
  - “They do not generate tax revenue for the government, but do create more responsibility.”
  - “They provide an incentive to smuggle goods illegally in order to avoid the quota, thus creating black markets.”
  - “In addition, quotas may be manipulated by foreign firms to limit competition from other foreign firms. For example, if there is a quota on German cars imported into the United States, then the German firm that first fills the quota has effectively blocked other German firms from competing in the American market.”
  
- `Embargoes` -- “An embargo is a ban on trade with another country. The purpose of an embargo is usually to punish a country for some offense.”

# “TRADITIONAL ECONOMIES, COMMAND ECONOMIES, AND MARKET ECONOMIES”

- “A study of different economic systems will shed some light.”

- `Different Economics Systems` -- “In order to survive, societies must make decisions about how to best use their scarce resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability). Economists have concluded that for societies to survive with their limited resources, they must answer three basic questions:”
  - What to Produce ?
  - How to Produce ?
  - Whom to Produce ?
  
  “Throughout history, people have developed a variety of systems to answer these questions. Most primitive societies developed what economists refer to as traditional economies. With the development of civilization came command economies, and following the Enlightenment, market economies finally emerged”

- `Traditional Economies` -- “In a traditional economic system, the questions of what and how to produce and whom to produce for are answered by tradition. If you’ve seen a documentary on a primitive culture, then you’ve also seen a traditional economy in action. The Kalahari Bushmen live in one of the world’s harshest environments, where even the most basic resources are in meager supply. In order to survive and have enough food, the Bushmen have developed a division of labor based on gender. Women perform the food gathering and men perform the hunting. The food is then shared with the whole tribe. In this type of system, stability and continuity are favored over innovation and change”

- `Command Economies` -- “As hunter-gatherer societies grew and eventually exhausted their natural food supplies, some survived by becoming sedentary farmers. With the advent of farming came a need for an organized system of “planting, harvesting, and storing crops. This required a greater amount of structure than existed in a traditional economy.”

  “Over time, decision-making became centralized, and the command economic system developed. The key characteristic of the command economy is centralized decision-making. One leader (or a group of powerful individuals) makes the key economic decisions for the entire society.”

- `At your Command` -- “During World War II, the United States practiced command economy when the government took over factories and planned production for the war effort. Every aspect of American life was in some way influenced by government involvement in the economy. Even today you can see the influence. The modern payroll withholding system was instituted during the war to provide the government with a steady stream of tax revenue”

- `Market Economies` -- “In total contrast to the command economic system is the market economy. Market economies are characterized by a complete lack of “centralized decision-making. As opposed to top-down planning, market economies operate bottom-up. Individuals trying to satisfy their own self-interest answer the questions of what, how, and for whom to produce”

  “Though it might appear counterintuitive, market economies achieve greater abundance, variety, and satisfaction than either traditional or command economic systems.”

# Capitalism Vs Socialism 

- “Today, traditional economies are few and far between, command economies are waning, and pure market economies are nonexistent. What does exist is a variety of command and market systems; in effect, economic hybrids. The two most common economic hybrids are socialism and capitalism.”

  “The difference between socialism and capitalism lies in the degree of government influence and state ownership of the factors of production. Countries that are capitalist rely on market prices for efficient product allocation, promote the private ownership of economic resources, and leave most economic decisions to individuals. They do, however, permit the government to:”
  - regulate markets
  - preserve competition
  - subsidize and tax firms 
  - enforce private contracts
  - redistrubate income from workers to nonworkers
  
  “For example, the U.S. government creates rules for the labor market, breaks up monopolies, subsidizes some farmers, taxes polluters, hears cases involving breaches of contract, and collects Social Security taxes.”

  “In socialism, the government takes a much more active role in the economy. Although individuals are allowed private property, the state may own firms in key industries and regulate even more economic decisions than in capitalism. In France it is not uncommon for the government to take a major stake in French companies, if not outright own them.”
  
- `Capitalism and Democracy` -- “Do not confuse capitalism with democracy. The two do not necessarily go together. India is the world’s largest democracy, but it is considered a socialist economy. Hong Kong has never really experienced democracy and yet it is the epitome of capitalism.”

  “More often than not, socialist countries manage the prices of many goods and services. The EU manages prices on such things as pharmaceuticals, cell telephone service, and food. Also, socialist countries are more active in taxing in order to redistribute income from workers to non-workers. Germany is well known for its generous cradle-to-grave social welfare system that promises care for its citizens. The German welfare state is financed by a redistributive tax system that many Americans would find intolerable. As of 2015, the highest marginal tax rate on personal income in Germany was 47.5% compared to the United States’ rate of 39.6%.”

# “BARTER AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MONEY”

- “Of all humankind’s inventions, money stands out as one of the most widespread and useful. A day probably does not go by that you don’t use it or think about it “From barter to shells to coin to paper to digital, the story of money spans much of human history.”

- `Funtions and Characteristics of Money` -- “Regardless of the form it takes (gold bar, dollar bill, oyster shell), money is anything that functions as a medium of exchange, store of value, or standard of value. Money acts as a: 
  - “medium of exchange when it is being used for the purpose of buying and selling goods or services.”
  - “store of value when you get it today and are still able to use it later.”
  - “standard of value when you are using it to measure how much a good or service is worth.”

  “Money works best when it is has the following characteristics: portability, durability, divisibility, stability, and acceptability.”
  - “Portability refers to the ease with which money can be carried from place to place.”
  - “Durability means that when you forget to remove it from your pocket before doing the laundry, you do not wind up broke.”
  - “Divisibility means your money can be broken into smaller units and end up finding its way between the cushions of your couch.”

- `The Evolution of Money` -- Across time and cultures, many things have served as money, including salt, tobacco, shells, large stones, precious and nonprecious metals, leather, and cigarettes, to name a few. Money can be a commodity in itself, a representation of a commodity, or a completely abstract symbol of value

- `Commodity Money` - -When relatively scarce minerals, metals, or agricultural products are used as a means of exchange, they are considered commodity money. Gold and silver struck into coins are examples of commodity money. An advantage of commodity money is that it can be used for purposes other than money. In the 1980s, many women adorned themselves in jewelry featuring gold coins, such as the Chinese Panda or the Canadian Maple Leaf. American colonists not only smoked tobacco, but they also used it as money. On the other hand, a commodity’s usefulness also makes it a disadvantage to using it as money. If a country is dependent upon using a commodity for its money and as a resource, then money may be too precious to spend.

- `The Gold Standart` -- Under a gold standard, money is backed by a fixed amount of gold. You could actually trade your money for gold. The gold standard allows a country to only print as much currency as there is gold to back it up, preventing overprinting and devaluation. Downside: it acts as a limit on economic growth. As an economy’s productive capacity grows, so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in gold, the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and

- `Represantative Money` -- Representative money developed as an alternative to commodity money. One of the properties of gold is its high density. Transactions requiring large amounts of gold would have been unpleasant due to it being extremely heavy and difficult to transport. Goldsmiths offered a solution to this problem. By issuing receipts for gold they had on deposit, representative paper money was born. Instead of trading the physical gold, all people had to do was trade the receipts for the gold. Whenever they wanted the actual gold, they could redeem their receipts. After years of acceptance, people became more comfortable with the idea of representative paper money and the concept stuck

- `Inconvertible Fiat Money` -- Because people were already familiar with representative paper money, the next step in the evolution of money was not all that difficult to understand. Why bother making the paper money redeemable in anything? Several times in history, the convertibility of representative money into gold or silver had been halted because of war or other crises. In 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order that transformed the dollar from being a form of representative money into what is called inconvertible fiat. Inconvertible fiat refers to both paper and virtual money that is intrinsically worthless and is not redeemable or backed by some real commodity. It is money because the government says so and we are willing to accept it
