# MONETARY POLICY

- The goal of monetary policy is to promote price stability, full employment, and economic growth. The Fed, a monopolist over the money supply, is in a unique position to influence aggregate demand in the economy. Fed policy affects excess reserves in the banking system, which directly influences the money supply, which, in turn, changes interest rates. These changes in interest rates lead to changes in aggregate demand via consumption, investment, and net exports. The resulting change in AD affects GDP, inflation, and unemployment.

- `HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE AFFECTS THE ECONOMY` -- The Federal Reserve influences the economy by applying pressure to interest rates and talking to the public. In the case of economic growth, the Fed can warn against inflation by ever so slightly raising interest rates whenever the economy seems to be growing too quickly. During periods of inflation, the Fed can mash down on the interest rate brake pedal, give a stern warning to the driver, and bring the economy back under control.
In the case of recession, the most the Fed can do is let off the brake pedal, or lower interest rates and encourage the driver to hit the gas. 

- `Reserve Requirement` -- A bank’s reserve requirement is the percentage of checking account balances that the bank is not able to lend against. If the Fed were to raise the requirement, banks would have fewer excess reserves from which they could lend. This would reduce the money supply and result in higher interest rates, discouraging capital investment and durable goods consumption. This decrease in investment and consumption lowers AD and leads to less real GDP, higher unemployment, and a reduction in inflation.
Lowering the reserve requirement would have the exact opposite effect.

- `Discount RAte` -- The discount rate is the interest rate that member banks pay the Fed to borrow money overnight, usually when they are in financial distress. Raising the discount rate discourages borrowing, but lowering the discount rate encourages it. If the Fed wants to reduce inflation, it raises the discount rate.

- `Open Market Operations` -- The primary way that the Fed enacts monetary policy is through the process known as open market operations (OMO). OMO is the buying and selling of U.S. Treasury securities (Treasuries) between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s open market desk and a select group of eighteen primary security dealers. The dealers include most of the world’s major banks and securities broker-dealers. They are

  expected to participate as counterparties to the Fed’s open market operations and share market information with the Fed. OMO transactions have the effect of either increasing excess reserves in the banking system when the Fed buys Treasuries from the primary security dealers, or reducing excess reserves in the banking system when the Fed sells Treasuries to the primary dealers.

- `WHEN POLICIES COLLIDE: FISCAL/MONETARY MIXER` -- During periods of recession, expansionary fiscal policy is reinforced with expansionary monetary policy. As government spending increases and taxes decrease, upward pressure is placed on interest rates. Expansionary monetary policy offsets the upside pressure on interest rates by expanding the money supply and lowering short-term interest rates.
Inflationary periods are more problematic for presidents and lawmakers. The contractionary fiscal policy prescription calls for reduced spending and increased taxes, which are politically unpopular.

# ECONOMIC GROWTH

- for an economist, economic growth is described more simply—it’s merely an increase in the GDP.

  Economic growth occurs when there is a sustained increase in a nation’s real gross domestic product per person over time. In most years the United States’ real GDP grows at a rate of approximately 2%. This means that on average, the economy doubles in size every thirty-six years
  
  Economic growth is not guaranteed. Indeed, there are years in which no or negative growth occurs. These periods are associated with recession.
  
- `Why grow` -- Proponents of economic growth focus on the benefits it creates for society. The advances in food production, healthcare, longevity, and material abundance would not be possible without economic growth. A century ago, most Americans were involved in agricultural production and yet subsisted on far fewer calories than today’s Americans, less than 2% of whom are farmers. The average life span has increased from 48 to 78 years in the same period because of the eradication of many diseases and advances in basic sanitation and healthcare.

  As the economy grows and diversifies, more and more people are able to escape subsistence farming and pursue other areas of interest. This freedom for most everyone to pursue their interest and passion did not exist for most of recorded history. The creative explosion of production that has occurred over the last 150 years has yielded advances in all fields of human endeavor. Where life was nasty, brutal, and short for most, it is now relatively humane, peaceful, and long. 
  
  All of this is possible because of economic growth.
  
 - `population growth and economics growth` -- To have human capital, you must have humans. For economies to develop and grow, it is important that the population grows as well. Population growth must also occur alongside productivity growth. Larger populations are capable of producing more output as well as more innovation because the greater the population, the greater the number of productive resources. The more people a country has, the more probable entrepreneurs it has. And

# CONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH

- Economic growth doesn’t happen by itself. It requires a number of different elements to occur.

- `Human capital` -- The most important element in economic growth is human capital. Human capital consists of the education, skills, and abilities possessed by an individual. Countries that invest heavily in human capital tend to have more economic growth than similarly endowed countries that do not. The United States is one of the world leaders in developing human capital. Compulsory primary and secondary education, mandatory vaccinations, and abundant nutrition have contributed to making America the most productive nation on earth. No nation spends more on educating and developing human capital than the United States.

  Individual freedom and the ability to acquire private property are also essential elements in developing human capital. When individuals are free to choose their vocation and enjoy the benefits of private property, their productivity is higher than in places where individual freedom or private property is not valued
  
  At first glance, a comparison of Russia and Japan would lead most observers to believe that Russia is far wealthier than Japan. After all, it has the largest deposits of minerals and natural wealth in the world. Japan, on the other hand, has few natural resources. However, Japan has enjoyed much greater economic growth because it has invested far more in its human capital.

  
- `human capital vs physical capital` -- Some capital replaces labor, while other capital enhances it. A robot that welds automobile frames replaces workers, but a pneumatic jackhammer both enhances and replaces workers. One worker with a pneumatic jackhammer can do the work of several workers armed with sledgehammers. Regardless of whether or not it replaces or enhances, capital leads to greater productivity.


- `Material abundance and economic growth` -- Material abundance is a benefit of growth and is often seen by critics as the driving force behind growth policy. They may be right, but if growth also yields substantive benefits for humanity, an extra iPod or McMansion might be a small price to pay. Material abundance is a natural outflow of humans being set free from subsistence agriculture to think, invent, and create. And even for those who choose to return to the land and farm, that freedom exists as well.

- `physical capital` -- Developing human capital alone is not enough to create economic growth. Economies must also invest in developing physical capital. Physical capital is the tools, factories, and equipment that are used in the production proces One of the failures of the Soviet Union was an ineffective use of capital. The Soviets built factories that dwarfed their Western counterparts. But because of inadequate infrastructure, they were often difficult to get to. This made distributing their output more

- `Research and development` -- Creativity, innovation, and invention are necessary for economic growth to continue. Western and Japanese firms spend far more on research and development than do firms in the developing world. Research and development requires sacrificing current profits in order to gain even greater profits in the future. For firms to take this risk, incentives must exist and be protected. Patents, which provide legal protection for inventors, provide the protection firms need to realize the profits of their research and development.

- `The rule of law` -- Another condition for growth is the rule of law. Government officials should obey the law and should also apply the law uniformly and fairly. Corruption and cronyism discourage domestic and foreign investment by effectively raising the cost of capital. Firms, individuals, and foreign investors must know that their property is protected by law. One reason that capital investment is lacking in the developing world stems from the fact that corrupt governments are far more likely to seize private property in the name of national interests. Venezuela’s seizure of foreign-owned oil fields in 2007 most likely deters future foreign investment. Unlike Venezuela, former British colonies such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong inherited the English common law with its emphasis on private property, which makes them safe and attractive to foreign investors. Foreign owners of capital have basically the same rights as domestic investors.

# HOW ECONOMIC POLICY AFFECTS GROWTH

- Government policies also play a role in determining economic growth. Stabilization policies by the central bank affect interest rates and thus capital investment. Fiscal policy impacts capital investment indirectly through the effect of government debt on interest rates. Tax policies that affect consumption and saving decisions influence economic growth by way of their impact on interest rates and work incentives.

- `Interest rate policy` -- Firms are unlikely to make long-term investments in capital if they are uncertain about future interest rates and inflation. To avoid uncertainty, the Fed must maintain a firm lid on actual and expected inflation

- `tax policy` -- Changes in tax policy affect businesses and are likely to also impact the rate of economic growth. Increasing the tax burden on firms reduces their ability and incentive to invest in capital. Increasing the capital gains tax on financial investors reduces the flow of savings firms use to make real investments in physical capital. Businesses faced with too high a tax burden may choose to produce elsewhere. It is important to understand that capital is free to flow. Placing taxes on business, although politically popular, is a recipe for reduced growth

- `flat tax` -- A flat tax is one that taxes all households at the same rate regardless of the level of income. Given a flat tax of 15%, a household earning $40,000 would pay $6,000 in taxes, while a household earning $100,000 would pay $15,000 in taxes. The benefit of a flat tax is its simplicity. The downside is that for many households a flat tax would represent an increase in their tax burden. Even though many are in the 20% to 30% marginal tax brackets, their average tax rates are much lower because of exemptions, deductions, and the fact that the marginal tax rate is only on the incremental income and not the total income.

  America has been the beneficiary of high tax rates in Europe. Europe has suffered a brain drain as its best and brightest, thus most highly taxed, move toward countries with lower tax rates.
  
- `the downsides of an economic growth` -- Economic growth is not without its downsides or its detractors. Economic growth has led to increased income inequality, which, if ignored, threatens continued economic growth. Over the last fifty years, income inequality in the United States has increased for a variety of reasons. The loss of union power, reduction in marginal tax rates, foreign competition, and meritocracy are some frequently cited reasons.
