# Monetary Policy

- The goal of monetary policy is to promote price stability, full employment, and economic growth. The Fed, a monopolist over the money supply, is in a unique position to influence aggregate demand in the economy. Fed policy affects excess reserves in the banking system, which directly influences the money supply, which, in turn, changes interest rates. These changes in interest rates lead to changes in aggregate demand via consumption, investment, and net exports. The resulting change in AD affects GDP, inflation, and unemployment.
