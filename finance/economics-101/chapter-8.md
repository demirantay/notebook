# THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

- Keeping score is important. Data and statistics are useful for making informed decisions. During World War II, the U.S. government wanted to better understand the economy’s ability to generate the necessary materials for the war effort. This led to the development of gross domestic product (GDP) as a means of measuring economic output. GDP is important today as an overall indicator of economic performance.

- Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of all final production that occurs within a country during the course of a year. GDP is also a measure of annual spending on new domestic production and a measure of income earned from domestic production. To better understand GDP, consider the following example. Assume a simple economy made up of Frank and Louise. Lately Frank has been complaining about the cold weather, so he offers Louise $1 to knit a blanket. Louise jumps at the opportunity to make a buck and commences knitting a new blanket. Upon completion, Louise exchanges the blanket for the dollar. In this simple example, what was the value of the economy’s spending, income, and output? The answer is $1

- In the circular flow model, the economy has three primary sectors: private, public, and foreign. The private sector is further divided into households and businesses. Each sector contributes to the gross domestic product. Households provide the factors of production that businesses use to produce goods and services. In addition, government provides the public goods not provided by the private sector.

- The foreign sector also functions as a market for domestic production.
GDP is represented in three ways in the circular flow model. The goods and services that business and government provide represent the value of all domestic production. The spending that the private, public, and foreign sector adds to the circular flow represents total spending. Finally, the rent, wages, interest, and profits earned in the factor market are a nation’s income.

# GDP: PRIVATE SPENDING AND INVESTMENT

- GDP can be calculated by adding all of the expenditures on new domestic output. Households, businesses, governments, and other nations all spend money in the economy and each is represented in GDP by a different spending variable. Each type of expenditure is subject to various influences, and each can reveal important information about economic activity.

- `PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE` - Households engage in personal consumption expenditure. Personal consumption expenditure, or simply consumption, is the act of purchasing goods and services. More than two-thirds of all U.S. GDP expenditures fall under the heading of consumption. In other words, Americans shop to the tune of $9 trillion or more per year for new domestic output.

- `Disposoable income variables` - Consumption is also sensitive to changes in consumers’ wealth, interest rates, and expectations of the future. Increases in consumers’ wealth tend to encourage consumption, while decreases tend to discourage it

  Durable goods like cars, appliances, and furniture are often purchased using borrowed money. Interest rates are then part of the equation to consume durables. High interest rates discourage durable goods consumption, and lower interest rates tend to encourage the purchase of durable goods
  
  Expectations as a determinant of consumption are easily understood. When people fear the future, they tend to save and not make any major purchases. In contrast, people that are upbeat about the future are more inclined to shop and less inclined to save.
  
- `Autonomus Consumption` -- Economists recognize that some consumption is independent of disposable income and refer to this as autonomous consumption. During periods of recession, consumption of durable goods is curtailed while consumption of essentials like food, rent, clothing, and healthcare remains relatively unaffected. 

- `GROSS PRIVATE INVESTMENT` -- Households and businesses engage in another expenditure referred to as gross private investment.
  - Gross private investment includes business purchases of capital and inventory, and household purchases of new homes. Gross private investment is further broken down into net investment and depreciation.
  - Net investment is the purchase of new capital that expands the economy’s productive capacity. 
  - Depreciation is investment spending to replace worn capital.
  
  It is important to note what investment is not. When it comes to calculating GDP, investment is not the purchase of stocks and bonds. That is financial investment or saving. 
  
- `Future expectation` - Interest rates are also a major consideration in the decision to invest. As interest rates rise, the relative profitability of investment decreases. Decisions to invest compare the expected rate of return to the current interest rate. As long as the expected rate of return. exceeds the interest rate, businesses will undertake investment with the expectation of profit. Increased interest rates have the effect of making fewer investments profitable.

- `Planned and Unplanned Invesement` -- Investment is divided into planned and unplanned investment. During periods of economic “normalcy,” businesses invest in capital and in inventory in order to turn around and sell it at a profit. This planned investment assumes that business conditions will continue according to the producers’ expectations. When unplanned investment occurs, it is a sign of bad things to come.

# GDP: GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND EXPORTS

- The GDP isn’t measured just by adding together private spending and investment by households and businesses in the domestic market. It is also affected by government spending and international trade.

- `governement spending` -- Government spending includes federal, state, and local expenditures on capital, infrastructure, and employee compensation. Military expenditures, road construction, and teacher salaries are all included. Government spending is financed by taxation and borrowing. 

  Government spending accounts for about 40% of the GDP in the United States. Government spending as a percentage of GDP varies widely throughout the world from a low of about 16% in countries such as Bangladesh and the Central African Republic, to about 65% in countries such as Cuba and Lesotho. In most developed countries, government spending as a percentage of GDP runs about 35–50%.
  
  Government spending is limited by the amount of tax revenue and the ability to borrow. Regardless of the political party in power, government spending tends to have an upward trajectory.

- `Net exports` -- Net exports, or exports minus imports, are the last spending variable in measuring GDP. Export of new domestic production adds to GDP. Imports, on the other hand, subtract from GDP.

  One last practical problem arises when measuring income versus spending. Producers and households have an incentive to underreport income in order to reduce their tax liability.

# Approaches to GDP

- So far we have looked at GDP as a sum of expenditures: add together consumer spending, private investment, government spending, and net exports, and voila! The GDP. But this is not the only way to measure the growth of the economy. Economists can also use the income approach (adding together income) or the production approach (adding together outputs). Note that each of these approaches is meant to give the same answer—the GDP.

- `income approach to gdp` -- The ability to engage in consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports derives from the income earned, producing domestic output. Again, income includes all of the rent, wages, interest, and profits earned by selling the factors of production in the factor market.
Measuring income is more complex than measuring spending, and this requires some mental gymnastics on the part of economists

  In the end, measuring income is a bit more complex for economists than measuring expenditures, but for now it is sufficient to conclude that income equals the sum of rent, wages, interest, and profits
  
- `Production or output approach` -- Another way of calculating the GDP is to add together all of the production activity in a country. In this approach, the value added at each stage of the production process is calculated. For example, a car is the final output but the engineer’s intermediate input has a value that can be determined. An obvious drawback to this approach is determining the difference between intermediate and final goods. Is a pound of sugar an intermediate or final good? The answer is, it depends on who is buying it and why. U.S. government agencies do not use this approach to calculate GDP.

- `Nominal vs real gdp` -- The concepts of nominal and real appear throughout economics, and GDP is no exception. Nominal GDP is reported using current prices. In order for economists to make valid comparisons in GDP from year to year, the price changes that occur with time’s passage have to be addressed. Real GDP reports output, holding prices constant. If the change in prices (inflation) is not accounted for in calculating GDP, results may be misleading—the economy may appear to be growing when in fact all that’s happening is inflation. Nominal GDP must be deflated in order to calculate real GDP

- `Business cycle measureements` -- Business cycles are measured by looking at both GDP and unemployment. During periods of economic expansion, unemployment is reduced and the GDP grows. The opposite happens in periods of recession.

<br>

# REAL GDP CHANGES AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

- Over the last fifty years, America has undergone alternating periods of recession and economic expansion. 

- `Expansion and contraction` -- Economists refer to this series of expansions and contractions as the business cycle (some economists prefer the term “fluctuation” since “cycle” implies a predictable pattern, which does not exist).
As the workforce and productivity grow, so does the economy’s capacity to produce

  During periods of expansion, spending increases to the point where the economy exceeds its long-run production capacity. Contractions occur as total spending decreases and excess productive capacity remains.

- `The four stages of business cycle` -
  - Expansion, which occurs when the GDP grows month-over-month, and unemployment declines.
  - Peak, which occurs when real GDP spending is at its highest—the period just before unemployment begins to rise and other economic indicators fall.
  - Contraction, which occurs when GDP growth slows or declines. A recession is specifically defined as two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP.
  - Trough, which is the period between contraction and expansion as GDP begins to recover.
  
  As this description makes clear, economists can only determine what stage the economy is in after it has happened.


# Theories of Business Cycles

- Economists disagree on exactly why the economy fluctuates as it does. Is the culprit external causes, such as wars? Or internal factors, such as business innovation? They also disagree on what should be done during downturns. How much should the government meddle? That depends on which economist you talk to.

  Milton Friedman’s monetarists explain the business cycle as being caused by poor management of the money supply. Periods of overexpansion are produced by too much money, and periods of contraction are caused by too little money in circulation. Most other theories explain the business cycle as ultimately being caused by spending changes, but one referred to as the Real Business Cycle Theory focuses on changes in productivity as being the ultimate cause of the cycle.

# WHAT GDP DOESN’T TELL US

- `gdp per capita` -- GDP per capita is the GDP divided by the population. As an indicator of overall well-being, it is subject to a major flaw. GDP per capita gives no indication as to how income is distributed among the population. The United States and Norway both have high GDPs per capita, but the key difference is that U.S. incomes are unequally distributed compared to Norway. High GDP per capita does not necessarily mean that there are not those in society living in relative poverty.

- `gdp and evniroenment` -- Critics of GDP say that it does not take into account environmental degradation. Because GDP is focused on spending and output, it creates an incentive to pursue greater amounts of production in order for growth to continue. This growth can come at the cost of the environment. Deforestation, climate change, pollution, and other environmental ills are, according to critics of the measure, the logical outcome of this narrow- sighted focus on GDP. Others defend GDP, stating that it is because of the increase in real GDP that people are wealthy enough and have the time to care for the environment. Today, the countries with the highest real GDPs are often the very ones that are doing the most to address the issues that environmentally conscious citizens raise.
Some countries are exploring measures called “green GDP” that take into account the environmental cost of economic growth.

# UNEMPLOYMENT DEFINED

- Many economists have made it their life’s work to minimize the problem of unemployment, and policymakers are under political pressure to do so as well.

  Persons sixteen years of age or older are considered unemployed if they have actively searched for work in the last four weeks, but are not currently employed. The employed are those who have worked at least one hour in the previous two weeks. People who meet neither criterion are not considered in the labor force, which is the number of employed persons plus the number of unemployed persons. The unemployment rate that you hear quoted in the news is not a percentage of the population, but a percentage of the labor force that is not currently employed.

  There are many reasons for not participating in the labor force. Full-time students, retirees, stay-at- home parents, the disabled, and the institutionalized do not participate. Members of the military on active duty are not considered part of the labor force either. At any point in time there are people entering, exiting, and re-entering the labor force. Furthermore, people are forever getting hired, fired, and furloughed. They are also quitting, cutting back, and retiring. The labor force is in constant flux, which makes measuring unemployment a daunting task.

# UNEMPLOYMENT CLASSIFIED

- Because of unemployment’s narrow definition, many people that you might consider unemployed or underemployed are not captured in the official unemployment statistic.
  - Marginally attached workers are not considered in the official unemployment rate. These are people ready and available to work, who have conducted a job search within the past twelve months, but have not searched in the last four weeks.
  - Some people have given up the job search in frustration. These “discouraged workers” are unemployed in the general sense, but because they do not meet the technical definition, the official unemployment rate does not reflect their numbers.

- `Types of unemployment` -- Economists make qualitative distinctions in the reasons for various classifications of unemployment. Not all unemployment is the same. Some types are actually positive for the individual and the economy. Other types are bad for the individual but benefit society. Last, there is one type of unemployment that is both bad for the individual and is costly to society. The three types of unemployment are frictional, structural, and cyclical.

- `government incevntives and frictional unemployment` -- Government incentives create variations in frictional unemployment rates between countries. Generous unemployment benefits give workers an incentive to spend more time searching for a job and thus increase the rate of frictional unemployment for the country.
Compared to Europe, American unemployment benefits are less generous. As a result, Americans spend less time searching for jobs and the rate of frictional unemployment is relatively lower.

- `frictional unemployment` -- Is 0% unemployment a good goal for society? It is most definitely not. A 0% unemployment goal ignores the presence of frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment occurs when people voluntarily enter the labor force, or when they are between jobs for which they are qualified. It is frictional because the labor market does not automatically match up all available jobs with all available workers.
Instead, a job search requires time for the right worker to find the right job. Both workers and society benefit when job applicants are matched to the appropriate job. You want mechanical engineers to get jobs in mechanical engineering, not pet grooming.

- `structural unemployment` -- Structural unemployment occurs when job seekers’ skill sets are not in demand because of geography or obsolescence. As industries die out in certain regions of the country or relocate to other regions, the workers may not be able to move with the job. This leaves workers with a skill set that is no longer in demand. These workers must either retrain or accept a lower-paying job in an industry that requires less skill. . As innovation occurs, old technologies and industries are destroyed, which frees up the resources for the new technology and its industry.
The invention of the personal computer was the death knell for the typewriter. As the new technology advanced, the old technology and its industry were destroyed
  
  As this was occurring, new jobs were being created in the new industry. The problem for workers is that their skill sets may not translate into the new industry.
  
- `cyclical unemployment` -- The most insidious type of unemployment is cyclical. Cyclical unemployment occurs because of contractions in the business cycle. It is not voluntary, nor is it the result of a skill-set mismatch. During periods of recession, the official unemployment rate increases as cyclical unemployment adds to the always-present frictional and structural rates of unemployment. The recession that began in 2007 saw the official unemployment rate increase from 5% to 10%. The additional increase is directly attributed to cyclical unemployment.

  The real problem with cyclical unemployment is that it creates a feedback loop. As one group becomes cyclically unemployed, they cut back on spending, which leads to more cyclical unemployment. This feedback loop resulted in 25% unemployment during the Great Depression.
  
- `Full employment` -- When the economy is producing at its optimum capacity, cruising down the road at the speed limit, neither speeding nor driving too slowly, it is safe to assume that the economy is also at full employment. Full employment occurs when cyclical unemployment is not present in the economy. This economic nirvana is the goal that policymakers seek to maintain.

- `The unemployment tax` -- High rates of unemployment also affect businesses, since unemployment benefits are largely provided through taxes on businesses. Additionally, state and local governments trying to raise revenue during periods of high unemployment often raise tax rates on

# WHY UNEMPLOYMENT IS BAD

- Unemployment creates a measurable cost for the economy and individuals. The opportunity cost of unemployment is immense when considering the scale of the U.S. economy.
  
  When workers are unemployed, they are unable to produce output. According to the economist Arthur Okun, for every 1% that the official unemployment rate exceeds the natural rate of unemployment, there is a 2% gap between actual and potential real GDP. Given the GDP and unemployment figures from 2009, when actual output was $14 trillion and unemployment was 10%, and assuming a natural rate of 5%, actual output may have been $1 trillion to $2 trillion below its potential. By way of comparison, a $2 trillion output gap is like sacrificing the entire economic output of France.
  
- `PERSONAL AND SOCIAL COSTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT` - The costs to the individual are heavy as well. An extended period of unemployment can wipe out a family’s personal savings and leave them in debt. Unemployment disrupts the normal flow of life and if prolonged can possibly lead to health and psychological problems for affected individuals
  
  Prolonged, pervasive unemployment is directly linked to crime and civil unrest. Areas plagued with persistent high unemployment are also plagued with both violent and property crime
  
   Unemployment, it seems, creates the necessary condition for many of the world’s problems.

- `Trends in unemployment` --  Globalization has shifted many low- skill jobs overseas, which leaves America’s unskilled workers with fewer opportunities.
Demand for labor is driven by worker productivity. The more skills workers possess, the greater the demand for their labor. To stay competitive, future workers must realize that they are not just competing against their fellow Americans but against the rest of the world. The days when you could graduate from high school and get a good-paying job at the factory are gone, unless, of course, you live in China. To compete in the global job market, Americans must be willing to train, stay mobile, and constantly adjust to the changing needs of their employers
