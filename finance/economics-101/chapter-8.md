# THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

- Keeping score is important. Data and statistics are useful for making informed decisions. During World War II, the U.S. government wanted to better understand the economy’s ability to generate the necessary materials for the war effort. This led to the development of gross domestic product (GDP) as a means of measuring economic output. GDP is important today as an overall indicator of economic performance.

- Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of all final production that occurs within a country during the course of a year. GDP is also a measure of annual spending on new domestic production and a measure of income earned from domestic production. To better understand GDP, consider the following example. Assume a simple economy made up of Frank and Louise. Lately Frank has been complaining about the cold weather, so he offers Louise $1 to knit a blanket. Louise jumps at the opportunity to make a buck and commences knitting a new blanket. Upon completion, Louise exchanges the blanket for the dollar. In this simple example, what was the value of the economy’s spending, income, and output? The answer is $1

- In the circular flow model, the economy has three primary sectors: private, public, and foreign. The private sector is further divided into households and businesses. Each sector contributes to the gross domestic product. Households provide the factors of production that businesses use to produce goods and services. In addition, government provides the public goods not provided by the private sector.

- The foreign sector also functions as a market for domestic production.
GDP is represented in three ways in the circular flow model. The goods and services that business and government provide represent the value of all domestic production. The spending that the private, public, and foreign sector adds to the circular flow represents total spending. Finally, the rent, wages, interest, and profits earned in the factor market are a nation’s income.

# GDP: PRIVATE SPENDING AND INVESTMENT

- GDP can be calculated by adding all of the expenditures on new domestic output. Households, businesses, governments, and other nations all spend money in the economy and each is represented in GDP by a different spending variable. Each type of expenditure is subject to various influences, and each can reveal important information about economic activity.

- `PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE` - Households engage in personal consumption expenditure. Personal consumption expenditure, or simply consumption, is the act of purchasing goods and services. More than two-thirds of all U.S. GDP expenditures fall under the heading of consumption. In other words, Americans shop to the tune of $9 trillion or more per year for new domestic output.

- `Disposoable income variables` - Consumption is also sensitive to changes in consumers’ wealth, interest rates, and expectations of the future. Increases in consumers’ wealth tend to encourage consumption, while decreases tend to discourage it

  Durable goods like cars, appliances, and furniture are often purchased using borrowed money. Interest rates are then part of the equation to consume durables. High interest rates discourage durable goods consumption, and lower interest rates tend to encourage the purchase of durable goods
  
  Expectations as a determinant of consumption are easily understood. When people fear the future, they tend to save and not make any major purchases. In contrast, people that are upbeat about the future are more inclined to shop and less inclined to save.
  
- `Autonomus Consumption` -- Economists recognize that some consumption is independent of disposable income and refer to this as autonomous consumption. During periods of recession, consumption of durable goods is curtailed while consumption of essentials like food, rent, clothing, and healthcare remains relatively unaffected. 

- `GROSS PRIVATE INVESTMENT` -- Households and businesses engage in another expenditure referred to as gross private investment.
  - Gross private investment includes business purchases of capital and inventory, and household purchases of new homes. Gross private investment is further broken down into net investment and depreciation.
  - Net investment is the purchase of new capital that expands the economy’s productive capacity. 
  - Depreciation is investment spending to replace worn capital.
  
  It is important to note what investment is not. When it comes to calculating GDP, investment is not the purchase of stocks and bonds. That is financial investment or saving. 
  
- `Future expectation` - Interest rates are also a major consideration in the decision to invest. As interest rates rise, the relative profitability of investment decreases. Decisions to invest compare the expected rate of return to the current interest rate. As long as the expected rate of return. exceeds the interest rate, businesses will undertake investment with the expectation of profit. Increased interest rates have the effect of making fewer investments profitable.

- `Planned and Unplanned Invesement` -- Investment is divided into planned and unplanned investment. During periods of economic “normalcy,” businesses invest in capital and in inventory in order to turn around and sell it at a profit. This planned investment assumes that business conditions will continue according to the producers’ expectations. When unplanned investment occurs, it is a sign of bad things to come.

# GDP: GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND EXPORTS

- The GDP isn’t measured just by adding together private spending and investment by households and businesses in the domestic market. It is also affected by government spending and international trade.

- `governement spending` -- Government spending includes federal, state, and local expenditures on capital, infrastructure, and employee compensation. Military expenditures, road construction, and teacher salaries are all included. Government spending is financed by taxation and borrowing. 

  Government spending accounts for about 40% of the GDP in the United States. Government spending as a percentage of GDP varies widely throughout the world from a low of about 16% in countries such as Bangladesh and the Central African Republic, to about 65% in countries such as Cuba and Lesotho. In most developed countries, government spending as a percentage of GDP runs about 35–50%.
  
  Government spending is limited by the amount of tax revenue and the ability to borrow. Regardless of the political party in power, government spending tends to have an upward trajectory.

- `Net exports` -- Net exports, or exports minus imports, are the last spending variable in measuring GDP. Export of new domestic production adds to GDP. Imports, on the other hand, subtract from GDP.

  One last practical problem arises when measuring income versus spending. Producers and households have an incentive to underreport income in order to reduce their tax liability.

# Approaches to GDP

- So far we have looked at GDP as a sum of expenditures: add together consumer spending, private investment, government spending, and net exports, and voila! The GDP. But this is not the only way to measure the growth of the economy. Economists can also use the income approach (adding together income) or the production approach (adding together outputs). Note that each of these approaches is meant to give the same answer—the GDP.

- `income approach to gdp` -- The ability to engage in consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports derives from the income earned, producing domestic output. Again, income includes all of the rent, wages, interest, and profits earned by selling the factors of production in the factor market.
Measuring income is more complex than measuring spending, and this requires some mental gymnastics on the part of economists

  In the end, measuring income is a bit more complex for economists than measuring expenditures, but for now it is sufficient to conclude that income equals the sum of rent, wages, interest, and profits
  
- `Production or output approach` -- Another way of calculating the GDP is to add together all of the production activity in a country. In this approach, the value added at each stage of the production process is calculated. For example, a car is the final output but the engineer’s intermediate input has a value that can be determined. An obvious drawback to this approach is determining the difference between intermediate and final goods. Is a pound of sugar an intermediate or final good? The answer is, it depends on who is buying it and why. U.S. government agencies do not use this approach to calculate GDP.

- `Nominal vs real gdp` -- The concepts of nominal and real appear throughout economics, and GDP is no exception. Nominal GDP is reported using current prices. In order for economists to make valid comparisons in GDP from year to year, the price changes that occur with time’s passage have to be addressed. Real GDP reports output, holding prices constant. If the change in prices (inflation) is not accounted for in calculating GDP, results may be misleading—the economy may appear to be growing when in fact all that’s happening is inflation. Nominal GDP must be deflated in order to calculate real GDP

- `Business cycle measureements` -- Business cycles are measured by looking at both GDP and unemployment. During periods of economic expansion, unemployment is reduced and the GDP grows. The opposite happens in periods of recession.

# REAL GDP CHANGES AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

- Over the last fifty years, America has undergone alternating periods of recession and economic expansion. 

- `Expansion and contraction` -- Economists refer to this series of expansions and contractions as the business cycle (some economists prefer the term “fluctuation” since “cycle” implies a predictable pattern, which does not exist).
As the workforce and productivity grow, so does the economy’s capacity to produce

  During periods of expansion, spending increases to the point where the economy exceeds its long-run production capacity. Contractions occur as total spending decreases and excess productive capacity remains.

- `The four stages of business cycle` -
  - Expansion, which occurs when the GDP grows month-over-month, and unemployment declines.
  - Peak, which occurs when real GDP spending is at its highest—the period just before unemployment begins to rise and other economic indicators fall.
  - Contraction, which occurs when GDP growth slows or declines. A recession is specifically defined as two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP.
  - Trough, which is the period between contraction and expansion as GDP begins to recover.
  
  As this description makes clear, economists can only determine what stage the economy is in after it has happened.


# Theories of Business Cycles

- Economists disagree on exactly why the economy fluctuates as it does. Is the culprit external causes, such as wars? Or internal factors, such as business innovation? They also disagree on what should be done during downturns. How much should the government meddle? That depends on which economist you talk to.

  Milton Friedman’s monetarists explain the business cycle as being caused by poor management of the money supply. Periods of overexpansion are produced by too much money, and periods of contraction are caused by too little money in circulation. Most other theories explain the business cycle as ultimately being caused by spending changes, but one referred to as the Real Business Cycle Theory focuses on changes in productivity as being the ultimate cause of the cycle.
