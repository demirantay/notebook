# INFLATION DEFINED

- Were you a little frustrated a few years back when gas prices suddenly rose? The increase in gas prices probably created some hardship as you altered your spending in order to accommodate its higher cost. Now imagine that not just gas prices, but the price of almost everything you buy, suddenly and unexpectedly increases. If you are on a fixed income, then there is only so much altering you can do to a budget before you realize that high prices are killing your finances. Inflation is a phenomenon that you need to understand if you want to comprehend how the economy works.

- `What is inflation` -- No word strikes more fear into the hearts of central bankers than inflation. Defined as a general increase in prices or as a decrease in money’s purchasing power, inflation creates problems for more than central bankers. Inflation affects everyone in the economy. Governments, businesses, and households are subject to inflation’s influence.

  Inflation is either created by excessive demand or increases in producers’ per-unit costs, but it is sustained by too much money in circulation. Left unchecked, inflation can have cataclysmic results for a society.
  
- `measuring inflation` -- Inflation is the rate of increase in the average price level of the economy. To measure inflation first requires that the price level be measured. Economists have come up with different ways to measure the general price level in the economy, and therefore, inflation.
  - Consumer price index (CPI): The consumer price index is a market basket approach to measuring inflation constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Changes in the CPI indicate inflation or deflation. CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation in the American economy.
  - Producer price index (PPI): A measure of producer price inflation that acts as a leading indicator of future consumer price inflation.
  - Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator: A price index used to measure consumer price inflation that is more inclusive than the popular consumer price index (CPI).
 

- `The CPI` --  is a market basket approach to measuring the price level and inflation published by the BLS. The CPI measures the average cost of food, clothing, shelter, energy, transportation, and healthcare that the average urban consumer buys. To understand CPI, imagine that you are given a shopping list of thousands of different items. You are then told to research and write down the price of each specific item, and afterward add them all together. The total cost of the list would represent an average price level.
Further assume that a year later you took the same list and repeated the process. Increases in the shopping list’s total would represent inflation.

- `The PPI` -- The PPI is similar to the CPI, but instead of consumer prices, the PPI looks at producer prices. The PPI includes all domestic production of goods and services. Unlike the CPI, the PPI also includes the prices of goods sold by one producer to another. Changes in the PPI can be used as a predictor of future changes in the CPI. Before consumer prices change, the producer price changes. Because it predicts changes in the CPI, the government and central bank use the PPI to create fiscal and monetary policy in anticipation of possible consumer inflation.

- `The PCE deflator` -- The PCE deflator is a broad measure of consumer inflation published by the BEA. Unlike the CPI, which measures a fixed market basket, the PCE deflator measures all of the goods and services consumed by households and nonprofit institutions. The PCE deflator is a more comprehensive measure. Because it does not deal with a fixed market basket, it better reflects consumers’ tendency to substitute more expensive items with less expensive items and their tendency to vary consumption as time passes.

# Types of Inflation

- There are two primary types of inflation: demand-pull and cost-push. Understanding which type of inflation is occurring at any given point in time is important if policymakers want to respond appropriately. The two types of inflation are not mutually exclusive, so it is possible for both to occur simultaneously. 

- `Demand pull inflation` -- Demand-pull inflation occurs when spending on goods and services drives up prices. In other words, aggregate demand is greater than aggregate supply. Demand-pull inflation is fueled by income, so efforts to stop it involve reducing consumers’ income or giving consumers more incentive to save than to spend.

  If government spending is financed by printing currency or by the central bank monetizing the debt, demand-pull inflation can become hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is defined as annual inflation of 100% or greater. All cases of hyperinflation have been accompanied by the government or central bank issuing too much money.
  
- `Cost push inflation` -- Cost-push inflation occurs when the price of inputs increases. Businesses must acquire raw materials, labor, energy, and capital to operate. If the price of these were to rise, it would reduce the ability of producers to generate output because their unit cost of production had increased. If these increases in production cost are relatively large and pervasive, the effect is to simultaneously create higher inflation, reduce real GDP, and increase the unemployment rate.

  The policy prescription for each is different, and applying the wrong prescription can create more problems than it solves.

- `the good inflation` -- A small amount of inflation is considered healthy for the economy, as the anticipation that prices will rise increases demand. This increased demand helps the economy expand. But when inflation jumps higher, demand increases too much (as people anticipate much higher prices), creating demand-pull inflation and ever-higher prices. The magic number seems to be 2%. At a 2% annual rate of inflation, prices are relatively stable and slow-growing. A

- `overprinting and inflation` -- In the past, many governments in the developing world tried erasing their foreign debts by overprinting their currency. Faced with much external debt, governments would devalue their currency in order to satisfy the debt

# INFLATION: WINNERS AND LOSERS

- Inflation creates winners and losers. Knowing who wins is important for understanding why it is sometimes allowed to persist. When inflation is expected and stable, it is rather benign. People and institutions can plan for it and build it into their decision-making. If inflation is unexpected, it creates a win-lose situation in society

- `benefit from inflation` -- First consider what inflation is: a general increase in prices and a corresponding decrease in money’s purchasing power. Borrowers benefit from a general increase in prices or a reduction in purchasing power. When individuals, businesses, and governments borrow, it is usually at a fixed rate of interest that had some expected level of inflation built into it. If higher than expected inflation occurs, then the real value of the borrower’s debt is reduced.
Assume that banks lend billions of dollars at a fixed nominal interest rate of 5%. If inflation were to unexpectedly increase from 2% to 4%, then borrowers’ real interest rate paid would be reduced from 3% to 1%.

- `losing with inflation` -- Inflation harms more than helps. Lenders and savers both lose when inflation exceeds expectations. Both earn interest rates that assume some rate of inflation, and when the actual rate exceeds the expected rate, savers and lenders are harmed. Maybe you save money in a bank CD. Assume you purchase a $1,000 one- year simple CD that pays 4% nominal interest. If inflation increases unexpectedly from 2% to 5%, then the real interest rate you earn is approximately −1%. You’re worse off than when you started. In nominal terms you still made $40 of interest. The problem is that the $1,040 that you now have has less purchasing power than the $1,000 you started with.

  Inflation creates practical problems for individuals and businesses in an economy. Because money is quickly losing value, consumers must engage in transactions more frequently as they rush to spend whatever money they have.

# Disinlation and deflation

- Disinflation is beneficial to an economy for several reasons. Disinflation reduces pressure to increase wages, as prices are more stable. Disinflation also results in lower, more stable interest rates, which makes capital investment less costly and easier to plan.

  which results in a profoundly more stable economic environment.

- One of the interesting features of economics is the possibility for self-fulfilling prophecies The fear of inflation or the general expectation that inflation will occur is often enough to spark an inflationary period. Consumers fearful of inflation will spend more and save less, which results in demand-pull inflation. The resulting demand-pull inflation reinforces the expectation of future inflation, and wage earners demand higher nominal wages to offset the effects.

  Central bank authorities try to manage not only actual inflation, but more importantly, the expectation of future inflation. Because the fear of inflation is often enough to create it, policymakers are in the business of acting as a psychologist to the economy.
  
- `Deflation` -- If inflation is bad and disinflation is better, then deflation must be best, right? Wrong. Deflation occurs when the average price level is declining and money’s purchasing power is increasing. What could be wrong with that? The problem with deflation is that it creates a perverse set of incentives in the economy. If prices are steadily declining, then consumers delay their purchase of durable goods as the deals just keep getting better as time passes. If this behavior continues, manufacturing grinds to a halt and widespread unemployment results

  Deflation poses a policy dilemma for central banks that primarily use interest rates to influence economic activity. In response to increased inflation, central banks raise interest rates to reduce the flow of credit and cool inflation pressure. There is no upper limit to how high an interest rate can go, but the opposite is not true. 
  
  
- `deflation solution` -- The solution for deflation is to create inflation. Milton Friedman suggested that in economies with an inconvertible fiat money standard, deflation should never be a problem. All the monetary authorities would need to do is print money, or in the case of economies with independent central banks, monetize the debt, and the deflation would end. It’s been said that this policy is like a government ending deflation by dropping cash from helicopters over the landscape. This policy solution was reiterated in 2002 by Benjamin Bernanke, which earned the Fed chairman the nickname “Helicopter Ben.”

# AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY

- Once you understand the concepts of supply and demand, GDP, unemployment, and inflation, you have a toolkit for understanding the economic fluctuations that occur. The aggregate demand and aggregate supply model will allow you to analyze the entire economy. You’ll even be able to predict what might happen given certain events.

- `Aggerate Demand` -- Recall that demand is the willingness and ability of consumers to purchase a good or service at various prices in a specific period of time. Aggregate demand (AD) is a similar concept, but has some important distinctions. AD is the demand for all final domestic production in a country. Instead of just households, AD comes from all sectors of the economy

   as the price level rises, money and other financial assets lose purchasing power. Fewer people demand our exports, and corresponding higher interest rates discourage investment and consumption. As the price level decreases, purchasing power increases, exports become more affordable to foreigners, and the corresponding lower interest rates encourage investment and consumption.
Changes in AD occur when consumption, private investment, government spending, or net exports change independent of changes in the price level. For example, if the general mood of the country improves and consumers and businesses are feeling more confident, they will consume and invest more, regardless of the price level. This increase in consumption and investment increases AD

  If government raises the average tax rates on income,households’ disposable income is reduced, and they consume less, which reduces AD.
  
- `Aggerate Supply` -- Supply is the willingness and ability of producers to generate the output of some good or service at various prices in a specific time period. Aggregate supply is a much broader concept than supply because it is inclusive of all domestic production, not just a singular good or service

# Macroeconomic Euibilirium

- The classical view of the economy is one that emphasizes the inherent stability of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Efficient markets are able to quickly and effectively reach equilibrium conditions, so periods of extended unemployment are not possible. When consumers stop spending, they are saving instead. This increased saving reduces the real interest rate and spurs investment in capital, so any decreases in consumption are offset by increases in investment. This leads to the conclusion that AD is stable.
If shocks do occur to the economy, flexible wages and prices allow the economy to quickly adjust to changes in the price level, as rational economic actors take into account all available information when making decisions. For example, workers will accept lower wages in response to deflation and demand higher wages in response to inflation. This quick response implies that the economy tends to remain at its long-run equilibrium of full employment

# The FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

- The Fed is not America’s first central bank or even its second. Regardless of your feelings toward it or the history behind it, the Fed is at the center of the American economy and deserves your careful consideration. The Panic of 1907 showed that America needed a central bank to act as a lender of last resort to ensure liquidity in the banking system.

- `cash on hand` -- Most of the money on deposit with the Federal Reserve exists in electronic form, but each of the district banks has a significant vault with millions of dollars under heavy security. In the early days of the Fed, the teller window was protected from bank robbers by pillbox- encased machine guns.

- `the creation of federal reserve system` -- The 1913 passage of the Federal Reserve Act, signed into law by Woodrow Wilson, created the Federal Reserve System. Unlike previous attempts at central banking, the Fed drew from the strengths of its predecessors. Instead of creating a single central bank, the Federal Reserve Act established a decentralized, public-private banking system. The Fed is not headquartered in a single location, but has separate locations across the United States. The Federal Reserve is neither a purely governmental institution, nor is it a purely private institution. The Fed has features of both.

  The Fed is the bank for the U.S. government. The Treasury keeps its accounts with the U.S. government and the government in turn writes checks from its accounts with the Fed. The taxes collected and the money borrowed through issuing government bonds are all deposited in the U.S. Treasury’s account with the Fed. Every time a taxpayer receives a refund, or a Social Security recipient receives their check, the checks are being drawn from the Treasury’s account with the Fed.
  
  The Federal Reserve System’s government arm, the Board of Governors, is headquartered in Washington DC. The governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for single, staggered fourteen-year terms. The Board is supervised by the Fed chairman and vice chairman, who are also members of the Board. The chairman and vice chairman are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for unlimited four-year terms. The Fed chairman is the face of the Federal Reserve System and is considered by many to be second in power only to the President of the United States when it comes to economic influence. 
  
- `The FOMC` -- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the chief architect of the nation’s monetary policy. The twelve voting members of the committee are made up of the Fed chairman, the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s president, and four other district bank presidents who serve on a rotating basis, although all the district bank presidents are present at the committee meetings. The FOMC meets eight times a year, or about once every six weeks, to review economic performance and decide the course of monetary policy by targeting the fed funds rate. FOMC meetings are closely monitored by the press and financial markets. Members of the media and investors carefully analyze the FOMC’s press releases, looking for clues as to what might be the future direction of policy.
