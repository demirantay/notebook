# GOVERNMENT IN THE MARKETPLACE: TAXES AND SUBSIDIES

- Government has a power that businesses envy. It is the power to coerce payment, better known as taxation. A subsidy is a sum of money given by the government to an
industry or business in order to help support it

- `How taxation shapes markets` -- All effective governments have the power to tax. Taxes can be used as a tool of microeconomic policy. For example, if government wants to reduce the production of a certain good, they can tax the producer. This raises the cost of production for the producer and reduces the supply in the market.

  The government can use taxation to raise revenue without the intention of reducing production. For example, luxury taxes on expensive goods and services raise revenue without necessarily affecting the market. If you’re going to buy an expensive automobile, whether you spend $500,000 or $501,000 doesn’t make a great deal of difference in your purchasing decision.
So-called “sin” taxes (taxes on nonessential but popular products like alcohol and cigarettes) are intended to generate revenue but they are also intended to reduce consumption of products considered undesirable (although not illegal) by the government. High taxes on such goods can lead to black markets in them

- `how subsidies shape the markets` -- Subsidies are used by government to encourage rather than discourage the production of certain goods and services. Subsidies have the effect of increasing the supply of the good or service and reducing its price. Many farmers and ranchers are subsidized by the government. Subsidizing farm goods ensures that there is always more than enough food and gives American farm exports a price advantage Critics of farm subsidies argue that it creates inefficiency and misallocates scarce resources.

  Some government subsidies are indirect (such as a tax break or low-interest loan guarantee) but are still used to implement economic policies and to affect the market. (Tax subsidies are one reason the income tax code is so complicated!
  
  Other subsidies are directed at consumers rather than producers (for example, a rent subsidy for a low- income earner

# Market Failures

- Sometimes the market fails to provide a necessary good or service or fails to properly assign costs. Economists refer to this as a market failure. Government has the capacity to step in and deal with such market failures in a variety of ways

- `Positive Externality` -- Sometimes the production of a good or service creates a spillover or unintended benefit for someone who is neither the producer nor the consumer. Such a spillover benefit is called a positive externality. Assume you live in a typical American neighborhood. If your neighbors were to landscape and remodel their home in such a way that significantly increased its value, you also would benefit. Your home would also appreciate in value, but you paid nothing for the increase. Flu vaccines create a positive externality as well.  Economists refer to these people as free-riders.

- `Negative Externality` -- Negative externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good or service creates spillover costs to society. Pollution is an example of a negative externality of the production process. For example, a shoe manufacturer produces shoes, but it also produces air pollution that is released outside the factory

  When a firm’s production creates a negative externality, there is too much of the good being produced. In a situation like this, government can tax the producer to reduce the amount of shoes, and pollution, produced.

- `Black Markets` -- Despite the best efforts of government, whenever and wherever government attempts to control prices or meddle with the forces of supply and demand, you can be sure a black market (illegal trade) will develop. Markets develop when there is a supply of and a demand for a product. It does not matter what it is. If someone makes it and people want it, there is a market for it. Furthermore, if government intervention creates surpluses or shortages, some enterprising individual will step in and provide a means of circumventing government and clearing the market.


- `Thwarting Price Ceilings` -- When government establishes a maximum price, shortages result for the good or service. Sporting events also provide an example of the inefficient outcome created by price controls. Who wants to see an event more, someone willing to pay $50 or someone willing to pay $1,000? When ticket prices are limited, those willing to pay more are forced to compete with those who would actually receive less utility from seeing the event.

- `Thwarting Price Floors` -- Markets also develop to thwart price floors. Workers willing to work for less than minimum wage might resort to contract labor or receiving illegal cash payments. Situations where workers are forced to accept low wages or face deportation are not mutually beneficial, nor are they voluntary. Exploitation occurs when one party to a transaction is unable to freely choose whether or not to engage in the transaction

# FINANCIAL MARKETS AND LOANABLE FUNDS THEORY

-  Even though they appear complicated, financial markets serve a very basic purpose: to connect the people who have money with the people who want money

- `loanable funds theory` -- Economists offer a simple model for understanding financial markets and how the real interest rate is determined. (Remember that the real interest rate is the amount of nominal interest left standing after the rate of inflation is accounted for/subtracted.) Like many bright ideas economists come up with, this model is purely imaginary but it helps to explain what happens in financial markets. The hypothetical market they’ve identified is referred to as the loanable funds market. It exists to bring together “savers” and “borrowers.” Savers supply and borrowers demand

  According to the law of supply, producers are only willing to offer more if they can collect a higher price because they face ever-increasing costs. In the loanable funds market, the price is the real interest rate.
  
  According to the expanded view of the loanable funds theory, savers are represented by households, businesses, governments, and the foreign sector. Borrowers also are represented by these same sectors. Changes in the saving and borrowing behavior of the various sectors of the economy result in change in the real interest rate and change in the quantity of loanable funds exchanged. For example, a decision by foreign savers to save more in the United States results in a lower real interest rate and a greater quantity of loanable funds exchanged for the country. A decision by the U.S. government to borrow money and engage in deficit spending would increase the demand for loanable funds, and result in a higher real interest rate and a greater quantity of loanable funds exchanged. The loanable funds theory of interest rate determination is useful for understanding changes in long-term interest rates.

- `Liquidity Preference` -- John Maynard Keynes’s liquidity preference theory explains short-term nominal interest rates. Instead of looking at saving and borrowing behavior as the determinant of interest rates Keynes’s theory, the money market, as opposed to the loanable funds market, was central to explaining interest rates.
The money market is where the central bank supplies money, and households, businesses, and government demand money at various nominal interest rates. Central banks like America’s Federal Reserve act as regulated monopolies and issue money independent of the interest rate. Liquidity preference is the demand for money. At high nominal interest rates, people would rather hold interest- bearing non-cash assets like bonds, but as interest rates fall, people are more willing to hold cash as an asset because they are not sacrificing much interest to do so

# The Money Market 

- As previously described, the money market is where the central bank supplies money, and households, businesses, and government demand money at various nominal interest rates. Firms, banks, and governments are able to obtain short-term financing in the money market. Securities (financial instruments such as stocks and bonds) with maturities of less than one year are included in this market.

- `Commercial Paper` -- Businesses with excellent credit can easily borrow in the money market by issuing commercial paper, which is nothing more than a short-term IOU. For example, Behemoth Corporation is expecting payment from its customers at the end of the month, but has to pay its employees before then. In this case, Behemoth Corporation can issue commercial paper in exchange for cash with which to pay its employees, 

  Commercial paper is an unsecured debt, meaning that it doesn’t represent any type of ownership interest and no collateral is offered in exchange. You’re repaid by cash flow (as in the example just presented, once the customers pay Behemoth Corporation at the end of the month, you’ll get your original investment plus interest back). If the firm defaults on their repayment, you’re stuck without a lot of good options.
  
  Demand is much greater for higher-rated commercial paper. Commercial paper is usually sold in big chunks (say, $100,000 per issue), the interest is taxable, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) doesn’t regulate their sale. This is why money market funds are popular with private investors (the little guys like you and me).
  
- `Treasury  Bills` -- Like corporations, sometimes the U.S. government needs a little cash on hand to make the wheels of governance run smoothly. When it does, it auctions Treasury bills (T-bills) for its short-term cash needs. The T-bills have various maturities of less than one year. Investors like T-bills because they allow them to earn risk-free interest while maintaining liquidity in case they need their cash quickly for other purposes. The government benefits because T-bills provide the government with easy access to cash for government spending, and what government doesn’t love easy access to cash?

- `Federal Funds` -- Banks, like any other business, sometimes have to have access to more cash than they have tucked away in the vault. To meet their short-term financing needs, they lend and borrow federal funds, also known as fed funds. Banks may borrow from each other in the fed funds market to satisfy their legal reserve requirements or to meet their contractual clearing balances. This component of the money market is important for maintaining bank liquidity. It also increases efficiency by encouraging banks to put all of their available excess reserves to work earning a return

  The Federal Reserve affects this market by influencing the fed funds rate, which is the interest rate banks charge each other for the use of overnight federal funds.

# The Bond Market

- For long-term financing, governments and firms are able to borrow in the bond market. When investors buy bonds, they are lending money to sellers with the expectation that they will be repaid their principal plus interest. For bond issuers, the bond market provides an efficient means of borrowing large sums of money. For the buyer, bonds provide a relatively secure financial investment that provides interest income

- `federal government bonds` -- You are probably familiar with two types of bonds
  - Coupon bonds are sold at or near face value and provide guaranteed interest payments. 
  - Zero coupon bonds are sold at a discount from face value and pay face value at maturity.
  
  Either type makes an attractive investment for people seeking interest income while preserving their principal
  
  The U.S. government issues several types of bonds with maturities greater than a year. Treasury notes and Treasury bonds are primary sources for financing the federal budget.
  - Treasury notes are medium-term securities with maturities ranging from two to ten years.
  - Treasury bonds are long-term securities that mature after thirty years.
  
  In addition to the Treasury, independent agencies of the U.S. government are able to borrow by issuing bonds. Although they lack the guarantee of repayment that Treasury securities have The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) are well-known agencies that issue bonds in order to finance their operations. Agency securities provide an alternative for investors looking for the security of government bonds but with higher interest rates.
  
- `State and Local governemnt Bonds` -- State and local governments are also able to borrow through the bond market. Municipal bonds often finance schools, roads, and other public projects. The interest paid on the municipal bonds is exempt from federal income taxes, which makes them attractive to investors

- `Corporate Bonds` - Firms are able to borrow in the bond market by issuing corporate bonds. Corporate bonds provide businesses with the money they need for capital investment without having to arrange bank financing.

  The chief advantage of bonds is that they provide firms with financial leverage. For example, if a company has $1,000 to invest in capital and can expect a return of 10%, the company will earn $100 from the investment. If, however, the firm borrows $1,000,000 and invests in capital that returns 10% a year, the firm is able to earn $100,000 without risking its own money. Because firms lack the ability to tax to repay bonds (and therefore occasionally default on them), investors require a higher interest rate on corporate bonds than on Treasury and municipal bonds to offset the increased risk.

- `Bond Risks` - Bonds are not without their downsides.
  - Since the possibility exists that governments or firms may fail to pay back their borrowed money, all bondholders face investment risk.
  - If the rate of inflation increases during the life of a bond, the investor’s return is offset by the inflation
  - If interest rates increase during the life of a bond, the value of the bond decreases until its effective yield equals the new higher interest rate.
  - If interest rates decline during the life of a bond, the issuer may find it beneficial to retire or call the old bonds and refinance at the new lower interest rate. For bondholders, this means that they lose out on earning the higher interest they would have had when the bond matured.
  
  Prospective investors rely on rating agencies to determine the quality of the bonds. Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch rate bonds from “prime” to “investment grade” to “junk,” and all the way to “in default.”
  
  However, consumers should not rely only on bond ratings. Serious questions have arisen from the 2008 financial crisis about the rating process. During that time, many bonds were so quickly downgraded that investors who believed they were holding prime-rated bonds discovered that they had junk bonds within a short period of time

# STOCK MARKET 

- Of all the financial markets, none receives as much media coverage as the stock market. Unlike bond markets, where investors are making loans to governments and firms, the stock market is where investors are able to purchase partial ownership in firms represented by shares of stock.

- `Stocks Simplified` -- Companies that are privately held don’t issue stock for public purchase. Instead, they keep the shares among a small group of owners, often the founders. But for companies that want or need outside investment, trading on one of the stock exchanges is a good way to do this.
  - Firms are able to raise the money they need for capital investment by issuing stock in an initial public offering (IPO).
  - Investors purchase the stock with the expectation that it will either pay dividends or earn capital gains.
  - Investors earn dividends when a company divides a portion of the profits among all of the owners according to the number of shares each owns
  
  Stock earns capital gains when it is sold at a higher price than for what it was purchased. Suppose you purchase a share of General Motors for $35.75 and a few months later, GM announces a hot new car that runs on sunlight rather than gasoline. It seems likely that GM will earn lots of lovely money selling that car, so people want to buy stock in the company. Demand drives the price of the stock higher. When it reaches $50.25, you decide to sell and realize a capital gain of $14.50.
  
  The majority of stock purchases and sales occur in the secondary market. When you place an order to buy stock, you are most likely buying shares that were previously owned by another individual. If Tina buys Coca-Cola stock in the market, she is buying it from someone else, not Coca-Cola. If she pays $150 for two shares of Coca-Cola stock, some other investor who sold the stock will receive $150, but Coca- Cola will receive nothing. The only time the firm receives money in a stock purchase is through an IPO or when the firm sells stock that it had repurchased earlier.

- `Types of Stocks` -- Companies issue two types of stock, common or preferred. Common stock provides investors with partial ownership of a firm and also grants them the right to vote for the firm’s leadership. Preferred stock also provides an ownership claim on a firm, but does not allow for voting privileges. Preferred stock is so named because preferred stockholders get paid before common stockholders when it comes time to pay dividends.

- `So Whats the Point` -- Ultimately the function of these various markets is to allow savers to connect with borrowers. Businesses seeking to expand their capital investment look to the bond market and stock market as a source of needed funds. Firms are very conscious of their operating cost, so finding the appropriate combination of stock and bond financing, or capital structure, with which to finance investment is important both to the business and the economy as a whole.

  Are low interest rates enough to encourage investment? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no.
A firm’s decision to invest in capital is also conditioned on the expected rates of return. If firms expect higher rates of return, they are more willing to invest at each and every interest rate. If firms think there is little chance to earn a profit, then they are much less willing to invest in capital.
