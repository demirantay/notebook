# GOVERNMENT IN THE MARKETPLACE: TAXES AND SUBSIDIES

- Government has a power that businesses envy. It is the power to coerce payment, better known as taxation. A subsidy is a sum of money given by the government to an
industry or business in order to help support it

- `How taxation shapes markets` -- All effective governments have the power to tax. Taxes can be used as a tool of microeconomic policy. For example, if government wants to reduce the production of a certain good, they can tax the producer. This raises the cost of production for the producer and reduces the supply in the market.

  The government can use taxation to raise revenue without the intention of reducing production. For example, luxury taxes on expensive goods and services raise revenue without necessarily affecting the market. If you’re going to buy an expensive automobile, whether you spend $500,000 or $501,000 doesn’t make a great deal of difference in your purchasing decision.
So-called “sin” taxes (taxes on nonessential but popular products like alcohol and cigarettes) are intended to generate revenue but they are also intended to reduce consumption of products considered undesirable (although not illegal) by the government. High taxes on such goods can lead to black markets in them
