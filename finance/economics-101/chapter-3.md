# INCONVERTIBLE FIAT EXPLORED

- The inconvertible fiat standard that exists today addresses the weakness of the gold standard. The gold standard’s major disadvantage is that it acts as a limit on economic growth

- This flexibility explains why the inconvertible fiat standard persists. But remember that inconvertible fiat is only money because the government says it is and people agree. For people to agree, they must have confidence that the money won’t suddenly become worthless or the government backing it won’t topple tomorrow. So that people do not lose confidence in the money supply, the central bank of a country must carefully control its availability so that it does not become too plentiful or too scarce.

  Today’s money is intrinsically worthless and is only redeemable for more of the same. The system works because the government says so and everyone collectively believes it. Money is backed by nothing more than faith
  
  You work, pay your bills, buy your groceries, and manage to survive and even thrive in the economy, yet you can go for days or weeks without even touching, seeing, or smelling money. Money is imaginary. Ponder your bank account. There are not little stacks of dollar bills sitting in the bank vault
  
- `Losing Faith and Collective Despair` -- Because money is backed by faith, anything that erodes that faith is destructive to it. One of the biggest destroyers of money, or at least of the value that money represents, is inflation. Inflation is ultimately caused by too much money in circulation.

  Overprinting is dangerous because it causes the money to lose value and is therefore highly inflationary. During the interwar period, the German Weimar Republic overprinted their currency, and this led to rampant inflation and financial ruin. When the money is inconvertible fiat, the checks and balances inherent in the gold standard do not exist.
  
- `MONEY SUPPLY MEASURES: M1 AND M2` -- This strange stuff called money is managed and measured by the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) in the United States. There are two primary measures that the Fed uses when describing the money supply, M1 and M2.
  - The M1 measurement is composed of all of the checking account balances, cash, coins, and traveler’s checks circulating in the economy.
  - The M2 is composed of everything in the M1 plus all savings account balances, certificates of deposit, money market account balances, and U.S. dollars on deposit in foreign banks
  
  The M1 is mainly used as a medium of exchange, whereas the M2 is used as a store of value. The M2 is larger and less liquid than the M1. In general, if the M1 grows faster than the combined rate of labor force and productivity growth, then inflation will result. If, however, the M2 were to suddenly grow at the expense of M1 because people are saving and not spending, then that would tend to indicate that the economy is headed toward recession.

# THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND INTEREST RATES

- Economists observe that money’s value is affected by time: a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow As a result, when people lend money, they often ask to be rewarded with an additional payment— interest—to offset the opportunity cost and inflation. When you deposit money in your savings account, you expect to earn interest for the same reason. Otherwise you would just stuff the money under your mattress.

- `Principles of Interest` -- Interest is nothing more than a payment for using money. An interest rate is the price of using money. What determines this price? It helps to think of an interest rate as a set of blocks stacked upon each other. These blocks include:
  - opportunity cost
  - expected inflation rate
  - default risk premium 
  - liquidity premium
  - maturity risk premium
  
- `Basic Interest Rate` -- In other words, if you’re willing to forgo the opportunity to use your money for a 2% interest payment (also called a return), then that would be the basic interest rate for the money you’re lending. As you can imagine, the real interest rate varies from place to place and time to time. If most people are more interested in spending their money now than in forgoing its use to earn interest, the interest rate will have to rise to make them change their thinking.

- `Expected Inflation Rate` -- While the basic interest rate of 2% may repay you for your opportunity cost, it doesn’t account for inflation, which will eat away at that return. So, the second block of interest represents the cost of expected inflation. Assume that inflation has been stable for years at a rate of 3% and people are pretty confident that it will remain at 3%. A lender or investor will cover the cost of expected inflation and add 3% to the 2% real interest rate, to arrive at a nominal interest rate of 5%

- `Default Risk Premium` -- If there is a chance that the loan or investment will go bad, then it makes sense to add another block to the stack. This third block is referred to as default risk premium. The bigger the risk of default or nonpayment, the bigger the block, and the bigger the total nominal interest rate

- `Maturity Risk` -- One final block is added for maturity risk. As time passes, there is a chance that interest rates will increase. If this happens, the value of the investment decreases, because who would want an investment that earns only 2% when you can get a similar one that earns 4%?

# The Origin of Banking

- Banks are everywhere. In the time it takes to walk from one Starbucks to another, you’ll pass at least a few banks! From small towns to large cities, the ubiquity of banks reveals their importance to the economy. Much maligned of late, banks are an integral part of the economy. Without them, capitalism would not function.

- `Early Banking` -- The roots of banking can be traced to the earliest civilizations. The Egyptians and early societies of the Middle East developed the prototype upon which modern banking is based. In the Renaissance era, Italian city-states were home to the first banks, which financed trade, the state, and the Catholic Church. The successes of the Italian bankers induced a spread of banking further across the continent. From the time of the American Revolution to the Civil War, the United States saw an expansion of relatively unregulated banking that helped finance the growth of the young republic.

- `The Function of Banks` -- Banks serve a variety of functions in the economy. They act as safe places for people to store their wealth, they help to facilitate trade by providing alternative methods of payment, but most important, they bring together savers and borrowers. Each of these functions is critical to the smooth operation of the economy. governments, banks do serve an important security function. When you know that your private property is secure, then you are better able to enjoy your freedoms.

  By providing their customers with check-writing privileges, debit cards, credit cards, and cashier’s checks, banks help to facilitate trade. With multiple means of access to stored wealth, consumers are able to make purchases more often and in more places. This allows businesses to employ more land, labor, and capital, which in turn results in a fully employed economy
  
  Acting as a go-between or intermediary between savers and borrowers is probably the most important function of banks.These savings are then lent to borrowers at an interest rate higher than that paid to savers, allowing the bank to profit.
  
- `Capital REquiremenets Defined` -- Banks are required by law to maintain capital requirements. This is actual cash money (capital) that a bank must keep on hand to conduct its operations, usually a ratio that is related to the riskiness of its loans (riskier loans create greater capital requirements).

# How Banks Create Money 

- Contrary to popular belief, most money is not created on government printing presses. When banks accept deposits and make loans, money is created. To understand how this works, you have to know some accounting principles

- `Balance Sheets` -- A balance sheet compares the assets a bank owns with the liabilities it owes. If you have never taken a course in accounting, then you might not be familiar with the following equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder’s Equit
  - A bank’s assets include buildings, equipment, loans to customers, Treasury securities, vault cash, and reserves. This is basically everything the bank owns
  - The liabilities of a bank include customers’ deposits and loans from either other banks or the Fed. This is basically everything the bank owes
  - Stockholder equity, or a bank’s financial capital, is the ownership interest in the bank represented by shares of stock
  
  Because assets equal liabilities plus stockholder’s equity, a bank with (for example) $1 million in assets and $500,000 in liabilities would have $500,000 in stockholder’s equity
  
- `Bank Reserves` -- What exactly are bank reserves? Reserves are funds that are either available for lending or held against checkable deposits. The reserves available for lending are called excess reserves and those held against checkable, but not savings, deposits are called required reserve

  When the economy is healthy, banks tend to lend out all excess reserves. Why? Banks profit by charging interest on loans, so they have a strong incentive to maximize the amount they lend.

- `The Abracadabra Part` -- Money is created when the bank continues to lend its excess reserves. For example, a $100,000 checking deposit generates an increase in excess reserves of $90,000. If the bank lends the full $90,000 to a customer who in turn purchases a recreational vehicle, the seller of the vehicle might then deposit the
$90,000 in the bank.
  
  What happened to the checkable deposit balance in the bank? It grew from $100,000 to $190,000 in a short period of time. Money was created. The process does not stop with just this transaction. You can see that the bank now has $90,000 in new deposits. The bank will hold 10% as required reserve and lend the rest. The proceeds of the loan will be re-deposited, and now $81,000 of new money is created.
  
- `Money Divider` -- Just as easily as money is created, money can also be destroyed (the horror!). Remember, money is created when customers make deposits and banks make loans. Money is destroyed when customers withdraw balances and pay off loans. Consider the following example. If Maria writes a $10,000 check to pay off her car loan, checkable deposits are reduced by $10,000, and the money supply shrinks. What’s good for you personally may not be so good for the economy

# BANKS AS A SYSTEM: REGULATION AND DEREGULATION

-  Assume that Bank East is holding excess reserves, but has no opportunities to lend in its region. Bank West has no excess reserves, but has businesses and consumers clamoring for loans. Bank West can borrow from Bank East in the fed funds market and provide loans for its customers. Bank East profits by earning the fed funds rate, and Bank West profits by earning the higher interest rate it charges its customers. Everyone is happy happy happy

- `Bank Runs` -- Bank runs or bank panics have occurred multiple times throughout American history. Because banks operate with far less than 100% required reserves, it is possible that if enough customers demand their account balances on a single day, the bank will not be able to meet the demand. This of course would be catastrophic for the bank and its customers. The bank would be insolvent and the customers unable to withdraw their funds would be broke.

  Many bank panics have been caused because of rumor or speculation about a bank’s financial health. If enough people believe the rumor, they will logically want to withdraw their funds
  
- `Bank Regulation since 1900s` -- A widespread bank panic in 1907 led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which created the modern Federal Reserve System, America’s version of a central bank. The Fed serves as the nation’s chief bank regulator. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors regulates member banks while the Federal Reserve district banks supervise and enforce the board’s regulations

  Bank regulation kept American banks relatively small compared to banks in other countries. The banking sector effectively lobbied for deregulation in order to grow and compete at a national and even international level.
  
- `Bank Deregulation` -- Today, the banking industry is in flux. A push for regulation to prevent future bank crises exists. As the line between banks and other financial institutions has blurred, the task for lawmakers is to create a regulatory framework that encompasses all bank-like activities. History will show whether or not they were successful.

# SUPPLY AND DEMAND: MARKETS

- Many intelligent individuals throw around economic arguments using economic terminology and may even sound convincing, but there is a lot of bad economics going around! To have a good understanding of economics, you must have a grasp of supply and demand. The concepts are central to even the most complex of economic arguments, yet they are easily understood.

- `Whats a market` -- Markets are places that bring together buyers and sellers. However, markets do not have to be physical places. Markets exist whenever and wherever buyer and seller interact, be it a physical location, via mail, or over the Internet. Several conditions must be met in order for markets to function efficiently.
Typical conditions for an efficient market include a large number of buyers and sellers acting independently according to their own self-interest, perfect information about what is being traded, and freedom of entry and exit to and from the market

  A large number of participants in the market ensures that no one buyer or seller has too much influence over the price or the amount traded. It is obvious that if there is a single seller or single buyer, they will be able to exercise considerable influence over prices. For example, Walmart has what is called monopsony power over several producers. Because Walmart is the sole retailer for these producers, it is able use that power to influence the price it pays. In competitive markets, no one producer or consumer exercises that level of influence.

- `Monopsony and Monopoly` -- A monopsony is when theres basically one buyer for a product and a monopoly is when theres basically only one seller for a product.

- Freedom of entry and exit into the market also increases the market’s efficiency by allowing the maximum number of buyers and sellers to participate. Licensing requirements are an example of a barrier to entry. By requiring licenses to sell or produce goods and services, the government limits the potential number of sellers, resulting in less competition and higher prices

- `Competetive Markets` -- A variety of factors affect supply and demand, which in turn affect price and quantity. Changes in the market for one good will create changes in the market for another good

- `Advantages of Compatitive Markets` -- Why are perfectly competitive markets preferable to other types of market? Perfectly competitive markets are what economists call allocatively efficient. Consumers get the most benefit at the lowest price without creating any loss for producers. Perfect competition is also productively efficient because in the long run, firms produce at the lowest total cost per unit.

- `Unrealistic models explained` -- Do you remember the first time you learned about atoms in science class.  In economics, when studying markets, you begin by learning something that is somewhat unrealistic, but a simple model of perfect competition will help you to understand real-world conditions.

- `Conditions` -- Certain conditions are necessary for the functioning of an efficient market: a large number of buyers and sellers each acting independently according to their own self-interest, perfect information about what is being traded, and freedom of entry and exit to and from the market. Add to this list that firms deal in identical products and that they are “price-takers” (that is, they are unable to influence price much), and you now have perfect competition.
