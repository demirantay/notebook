# Economics 101 by Alfred Mill - Adams Media

# WHY UNDERSTANDING ECONOMICS MATTERS

- “In Economics 101, you’ll realize that economics doesn’t have to boring. In fact, exploring this subject will make you look at the world in ways that you would have never considered before. Economics lets you make connections “between seemingly disparate things like the rate of unemployment and dear old Dad’s tendency to replace his underwear. And you’ll understand the world better. When interest rates change, you’ll be able to predict the ramifications. A meaningful discussion of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and collateralized debt obligations will no longer sound like some strange dialect of Portuguese. While this is not a personal finance book, the principles of economics it describes will help you keep your own financial house in order.”

- “In economics, expectations become reality and money is just a social construct. That’s not boring, that’s mind-blowing! After reading Economics 101, you’ll come to know and love concepts like diminishing marginal utility, and everyone’s new favorite, quantitative easing. Wrapping your mind around these ideas will help you make better sense of the economy around you and why people behave as they do in money matters (hint: it’s not always rationally!). You can even put the information to use by “teaching your boss about controlling variable costs and maximizing profits. Exchange rates and savings flows will be like child’s play for you, capital and investment will take on a whole new meaning, and constructing a CPI and deflating nominal GDP will be second nature to you. Your poet hippie cousin that lives in a van and plays guitar will be thrilled when you explain to him why he is technically not unemployed.”

- “Economics isn’t just about defining abstract terms like some of those I’ve mentioned. It’s actually an exercise in philosophy! By that I mean economics impacts every aspect of your life and influences everything that you do. And I mean everything! Economics teaches that nothing is free. Costs are involved with every choice, even if the choice doesn’t seem to have any bearing on money matters at all. “Economics isn’t something done by nameless groups somewhere far from home”

# WHAT IS ECONOMICS?

- `Studying Scarcity` -- “Economics is the study of how individuals, institutions, and society choose to deal with the condition of scarcity. It is fascinating to see how people react to scarcity. Some create complex plans and systems to make sure that everyone gets their fair share of scarce resources. Others make things up as they go along. Everybody practices economics on a daily basis. From a single individual to the largest society on earth, people are constantly engaged in the struggle to survive, make ends meet, and even thrive given the relative scarcity they face.

  “The people who study these choices are economists. The field of economics is huge because people have an immense range of choices. Some economists study the decision-making of individuals and institutions; others study how nations handle scarcity. Economists develop theories to explain the behavior of whatever it is they are studying.”

- `The Child of Philosophy` -- “Economics has been around a long time, though it has not always been known by that name. Philosophers studied scarcity and choice long before the field was so named. The father of modern economics, Adam Smith, was considered a moral philosopher, not an economist.”

- `Microeconomics` -- “The field of microeconomics focuses its attention on the decision-making of individuals and businesses. Microeconomics is primarily concerned with markets for goods, services, and resources. Markets are central to understanding microeconomics. Whenever and wherever buyers and sellers come together to exchange resources, goods, or services, a market is created and the behavior of these markets is of particular interest to economists. ”

- `Macroeconomics` -- “Macroeconomics is the study of how entire nations deal with scarcity. Macroeconomists analyze the systems nations create or allow for the allocation of goods and services. The questions they ask are varied and of great interest to individuals and policymakers alike:”
  -“How do you measure the economy?
  - Why does unemployment exist?
  - How do changes in the amount of money affect the entire economy?
  - What impact does government spending or tax policy have on the economy?
  - How can you make the economy grow?”

- `Scarcity` -- “Without scarcity there would be no need for the study of economics. For that matter, if scarcity did not exist, there would be no need for this book. You’re not that lucky, “however. Scarcity is the universal condition that exists because there is not enough time, money, or stuff to satisfy everyone’s needs or wants. The stuff that everyone wants is made from resources”
  - “Land is inclusive of all natural resources and not just some random piece of property. Trees, mineral deposits, fish in the ocean, ground water, and plain old land are all included. Land can be divided into renewable and nonrenewable natural resources. Renewable resources, like pine trees and chickens, are easily replenished. Nonrenewable resources, like oil and Atlantic cod, are difficult to replenish. The payment for land is referred to as rent.”
  - “Labor refers to people with their skills and abilities. Labor is divided into unskilled, skilled, and professional. Unskilled labor refers to people without formal training who are paid wages to do repetitive tasks like make hamburgers or perform assembly-line production. Skilled labor refers to people paid wages for what they know and what they can do. Welders, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, and car“penters are examples of skilled laborers. Professional laborers are paid wages for what they know. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, and even teachers are included in this category.”
  - “Capital in economics does not refer to money, but to all of the tools, factories, and equipment used in the production process. Capital is the product of investment. Stop. Isn’t that confusing? Up until now you have probably lived a happy life thinking that capital was money and that investing is what you do in the stock market. Well, sorry. Capital is physical stuff used to make other stuff, and investment is the money spent on buying that stuff.”

- `“Is There Really Scarcity in America, a Land of Plenty?` -- “Scarcity exists for everyone. From rich to poor, all face the condition. Scarcity in America looks different from scarcity in Somalia to be sure. Here, there is plenty of food and clean water, but in Somalia both are lacking. Scarcity isn’t just a function of limited resources, but also of unlimited wants, and that is something both America and Somalia share.”

# “TRADE-OFFS AND OPPORTUNITY COST”

- “Whenever you use a factor of production, a cost is going to be incurred. Why? The factors of production are limited, not limitless. As a result, whenever you choose to use land, labor, capital, or entrepreneurship for one purpose, you lose the ability to use it for another. Take a resource like labor—your labor. Say that you can spend an hour writing a book, teaching a class, or weaving a hammock. The choices you face are called trade-offs. Assume you choose to weave a hammock. You can neither teach a class nor write a book in that hour of time. If writing a book is your next best alternative, then economists would say that the opportunity cost of spending an hour weaving a hammock is the hour you could have spent writing a book. Opportunity cost is the next best alternative use of a resource.

- `Impilicit and Explicit Costs` -- “Opportunity cost is sometimes referred to as implicit cost. For any productive activity there are explicit costs like labor, raw materials, and overhead, which are easily calculated, and there are the implicit costs, which are more difficult to assess”

- `Considering Opportunity Cost` -- “Opportunity cost is a bummer. Make sure to always count it when making a decision”

- `Marginal Analysis` -- “Economists like to think of people as little computers who always count the benefit of their decisions versus the cost of those decisions. Because you usually make decisions one at a time, economists refer to the benefit of a decision as marginal benefit. Marginal benefit can be measured in dollars or utils, whichever you prefer. Utils are the amount of utility or happiness you get from doing something. They can be converted into dollars easily.”
  
  “Marginal cost is a related concept. Marginal cost is simply what it costs to either produce or consume one extra unit of whatever it is you are producing or consuming”

  “If the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost, you would probably do it. If the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, you probably would not do it. If the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, it means you are indifferent.”

- `Assumptions in Economics` -- “Economists make certain assumptions when they’re talking about their favorite subject. They expect you to know (and agree with) these assumptions. The three big ones are:”
  - “Nothing else changes. Whenever economists make an argument such as: “If income taxes fall, then consumption increases,” it should be understood as: “If income taxes fall and nothing else changes, then consumption increases.” Did you catch the difference between the two statements? And nothing else changes is also referred to as the ceteris paribus assumption. Loosely translated, ceteris paribus means “to hold all other things constant.” So as you continue reading the book, remember that all statements about cause-and-effect relationships are made with the ceteris paribus assumption.”
  - “People are rational and behave rationally. Another assumption made by economists, and a big one at that, is that people behave rationally. Economists assume that people’s choices are made with all available information taken into account as well as the costs and benefits of the choice. Furthermore, economists assume that the choices make sense. The assumption that people behave rationally is subject to debate among different schools of economic thought, but for most economic decisions it is a useful assumption.”
  - “People are selfish. The last assumption made by economists is that people are self-interested. First and foremost, people. “is that people are self-interested. First and foremost, people think of themselves whenever it comes time to make a decision. Pure altruism is not possible in economics. Economists cynically assume that human behavior is motivated by self-interest”
  
  “The assumptions economists make are subject to criticism and debate. Many critics believe that the field has a tendency to be too abstract and theoretical to have any real-world value. The failure of most economists to predict the most recent economic downturn seems to support the view that economics ignores human psychology at its own peril.”

# “THE EMERGENCE OF FREE TRADE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE”

- “Which leads to a higher standard of living, dependence on others or complete self-sufficiency?”
  
  “The truth, however, is whether you are on your own or living at home, you are highly dependent on others for the food you eat, the clothes you wear, “and the roof over your head. In order for you to get what you need and want and enjoy a higher standard of living, you must trade with others.”

- `The History of Trade in 60 seconds` -- “For as long as there have been people, there has been trade. At first, trade was a simple matter. For example, people in a family exchanged food with their neighbors. Over time, trade expanded as people were exposed to new goods from faraway places and developed a taste for them. As tribes became kingdoms and kingdoms became empires, trade grew in importance. This growth in trade led to the emergence of the influential merchant class. These merchants braved hardships in search of profit, and their activities helped to form the modern world. Although the scale of trade has grown incredibly throughout history, what has not changed is that trade always occurs between individuals.”

- `Mercantalism` -- “One early theory of trade was mercantilism, which dominated seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European trade policy. Mercantilism is founded on the idea that a country, and therefore, individuals, are better off if the value of a country’s exports are greater than the value of its imports. Under mercantilism, the more gold a country amassed, the wealthier it became. As a result, countries competed to import cheap natural resources and then convert them into more expensive manufactured goods for export.”

  “Mercantilism had an obvious flaw. If a country is always trying to export more than it imports and everyone else is playing the same game, then someone is going to lose. In order to maintain a country’s export advantage, governments enacted many laws and taxes that distorted the flow of goods without necessarily making the people better off. In the end, mercantilism created a win-lose condition that harmed more than it helped.”
  
- `Free Trade` -- “The insights of eighteenth-century Scottish thinker Adam Smith were influential in bringing an end to mercantilism. He and others at the time saw governments’ mercantilist policies as misguided and prone to influence by special interests. He argued in The Wealth of Nations that if a country specialized in what it produced best and freely traded those products, then society would be better off.”

  “In his view, free trade led to greater wealth, even if it meant that sometimes you imported manufactured goods from people in other countries.One argument used in support of the idea of free trade is the theory of comparative advantage. Whereas Adam Smith had argued for a country to specialize in what it does best and then trade with others, another influential thinker, David Ricardo, argued that it is better for a country to specialize in what it produces at the lowest opportunity cost, and then trade for whatever else it needs. These two concepts are referred to as absolute advantage and comparative advantage”

- `Absolute ADvantage` -- “An absolute advantage exists if you can produce more of a good or service than someone else, or if you can produce that good or service faster than someone else. An absolute advantage implies that you are more efficient, that is, able to produce more with the same amount of resources”

- `Comparative Advantage` -- “A comparative advantage exists if you can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than someone else. In other words, if you sacrifice less of one good or service to produce another good or service, then you have a comparative advantage.”

- `Efficency and Comparative Advantage` -- “It is easy to overlook comparative advantage when determining who should produce what. Just because one person might be more efficient than another does not always mean that that person should be the one doing the task. Remember to always count the opportunity cost.”

- `Comparative Advantage and Economics Change` -- “An example might help. Consider 100 typical American high school students and then consider 100 young people of the same age in Bangladesh. In which country is the opportunity cost of producing a T-shirt higher? If you look at the American students, you would have to agree that they have more opportunities than the Bangladeshi. When Americans specialize in T-shirts, more potential doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, mechanics, firefighters, police officers, business managers, machinists, and social workers are sacrificed than in Bangladesh, where the majority of workers will most likely become subsistence farmers. The opportunity cost of producing T-shirts is much lower in Bangladesh than in America, and therefore Bangladesh has a comparative advantage in producing T-shirts. Even though the United States has the capacity to produce T-shirts more efficiently (absolute advantage), from an economic standpoint, it makes sense to trade pharmaceuticals, refined chemicals, capital equipment, and know-how for T-shirts.”
