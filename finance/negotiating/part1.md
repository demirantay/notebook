# Negotiating 

- Like most people, you work for a living. You run a small business. Or you’re a position player in a larger one. Or you’re employed in a nonprofit or public agency. Or perhaps you’re not part of the work force at all. Sooner or later (most likely sooner) you will need or want something from someone else. That someone else might be another individual, another organization, or an individual or organization inside or outside your business or organization. As for what you need or what, it could be a new hire, a labor deal, a supply of raw material, a professional consultation, financial advice, or even a meeting room. You need something from someone, and it’s important.

- That something may be large or it may be small. Now you have to meet with someone to obtain it. Since resources are precious, you have to try to get the best deal. You’ll have to do a little “give and take” to get the best value for your money, the best value for your time, the best value for whatever resources you have to offer.

  You have to negotiate.
It sounds scary. We hear of tense, drawn-out negotiations about labor agreements or peace talks to stop wars. The very idea of being on stage with such high stakes in the balance would scare most of us to death.
Fortunately most of our negotiations in real life are smaller and less critical—but still important

- `The main ideas` -- Negotiating 101 covers the main ideas, strategies, tactics, responses, and skills to help you through any kind of negotiation with any counterparty, anywhere. The underlying principles and themes of negotiation you’ll see throughout the book include:
  - Negotiating is everywhere. You negotiate while at work, at home, even during leisure activities. You may negotiate contracts for jetliners, for cleaning services, or with your kids for dinnertime; these are all negotiations. They differ in size and scope only, but not the basics.
  - Negotiating may be your profession, but more likely it is part of your profession. A few of us negotiate for a living. The rest of us—a vast majority—must negotiate to get the rest of our jobs done
  - Win-win is the way. When both sides win and meet some of their goals, musts, and wants from the negotiation, then the process goes faster, easier, and usually comes out better for everyone.
  - Negotiations should be “fast, friendly, and effective.” This favorite phrase should describe most interactions in your business or organization
  - The counterparty is not the enemy. When the counterparty is perceived as the enemy, the negotiation becomes much more negative, antagonistic, personal, and about ego. When you treat someone like an enemy, they do the same, and the win-win mentality is gone forever
  -  Negotiations should be for the long term. At the end of the day, negotiation is about reputation (yours) and relationship (with the counterparty). Doubtless you’re going to have to do this again somewhere down the road, and likely with the same counterparty.
  
- `The Negotiating Imperative` -- No matter what you do in today’s fast-paced business (and personal) world, every day you’ll encounter things you need or want. Not just things, but also behaviors and actions. Discuss them? Yes, it starts with that. But you’re not just discussing—you’re working out a deal. You’re working out an agreement. At its roots, negotiation is the art and science—the process—of getting what you want

# WHAT DO WE MEAN BY NEGOTIATION

- Say you run a video production business: Filmographic Production. You negotiate with customers over deals and gigs. You negotiate with contractors and employees over duties and price. You negotiate with a landlord. You negotiate with sellers and renters of equipment. You negotiate for the use of props and places to shoot. You negotiate with local police departments to close roads and run traffic breaks. You negotiate for studio time. You probably spend more time negotiating than shooting film. Every one of us negotiates every day. Not necessarily from sunup to sundown—but a lot. It’s an unavoidable feature of today’s life.

  Don’t waste time; negotiate when it counts. The outcome should be something you want or need, or to achieve a goal. You should not negotiate for negotiating’s sake—again a common downfall. Negotiate smart, not just often!

# THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN

- negotiation is not any of the following:
  - Not a confrontation. Yes, the two sides may have different views, goals, wants, or needs. But the discussion of those factors should be calm, civil, and factual—not an “I win, you lose” confrontation
  - Not an argument. Same idea. Both of you have something to gain from the negotiation
  - Not a disagreement. However, the negotiation may play a role in settling a disagreement.
  - Not a shouting match. Again, peace carries the day. Negotiation brings both sides together rather than driving them apart.
  - Not a win-lose proposition (in most cases). A win-lose mentality may create more advantage today but loses in the long run as you alienate your counterparty.

# NEGOTIATION AND THE FAST TRACK IN BUSINESS

- `the need for speed` -- All this negotiating has to be done faster than ever before. These days, business, technology, and products all move at a blinding speed. So does your competition, and if you don’t keep up with them, you’ll be left behind. In the case of the video production company I discussed earlier, you’ll get a very narrow window of time to negotiate the deal and a limited time to put the production together. You can’t spend all your time negotiating. You must get the negotiations done quickly so that you can move on to producing the new product. Your client has tight deadlines to meet, after all. If negotiations bog down, your clients will begin to look elsewhere and your competition will “get the worm” first!

  These days, there is often no time to hold face-to-face meetings with the players involved. Some part, if not all, of the negotiations will probably be done by email, phone, instant messaging (IM), or even text.
  
  The goal of every negotiation is to get what you need or want as quickly as possible so that you and your organization can move forward without delays. However, even at this accelerated pace, you must beware of harmful concessions or oversights—or of missing the boat completely. The price of being slow is high; the price of negotiating poorly can be even higher.
  
  The tactics you employ come from an assortment of traditional negotiating techniques, all sped up to accomplish what ideally is a win-win.

# NEGOTIATION AND NEW TECHONOLGY

- The advent of new technology and connectivity has enabled us to communicate more quickly and more effectively than ever before. If you don’t use the latest technology devices to negotiate or do business in general, you’re likely to be left out of the loop

# THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NEGOTIATING AND SELLING

- You’re new to the idea of negotiating. You were hired into your organization as an engineer, a technical expert. You had years of education to acquire a technical credential, because you didn’t see yourself as a salesperson. But now you’ve been invited into a negotiation to sell your product to an eager customer. You think to yourself, “How did I get here? I chose a career path deliberately to avoid becoming a salesperson. Sales is not what I’m good at, so why am I here?”

  The point—and you probably saw this coming—is that you aren’t selling. You’re negotiating. What’s the difference?
  
  Simply put: Selling is the act of persuading someone to buy your product or idea, while negotiating is the act of working out the details of the deal.
  
- `Negotiation-the basics` -- Perhaps you haven’t realized it, but you’ve been playing the negotiating game all your life. You were doing it as a child, then as an adolescent. You negotiated with your parents over free time, homework time, and dinnertime. You negotiated with your friends over swapping lunches at school, or who got to pitch and who got to bat in your street baseball games. You kept it up as an adult. These days you negotiate “business-to-consumer” to buy a car or a mobile phone or a vacation package. You negotiate “consumer-to-consumer” to buy or sell stuff on Craigslist or eBay. And at work you conduct “business-to- business” negotiations.
  
  All through this, consciously or subconsciously, you’ve been developing core negotiating skills and experiences. No matter who you are or where you came from, you have played the negotiating game. You may be better at this than you think.
  
  The idea is to put some structure around what you already do

# THE HISTORY OF NEGOTIATION

- Where, how, when, and why did negotiation become a part of civilized society? It really started as barter
the direct exchange of goods or services with no money or other intermediary item of value involved.
When the first barter in human history took place is unknown, but we do know that bartering has been around for much longer than buying and selling. It grew up as a system of give-and-take that accommodated anyone who chose to participate. Whether it was to acquire a chunk of lamb in exchange for some pottery or to obtain jewelry for a hand-painted headpiece, people found ways to fulfill their needs.

# THE NEGOTIATING GAME

- Negotiating, as we defined in Chapter 1, is about getting something important that you want or need. It is about achieving a goal through a give-and-take discussion with two or more parties. It can easily be seen as a “game” 

  A negotiation has a beginning, a middle, and a finish, with a strategy and desired outcome envisioned beforehand. 
  
  Like a game of chess, in a negotiation there are many possible intermediate positions you can reach to get to the ultimate goal. Your success depends on how you go about achieving those positions and responding to your counterparty’s moves—as you don’t control everything. However, because there are multidimensional goals and negotiating points, in many ways a business negotiation is more complex and involved than a game of chess. As well, there are far more interpersonal and human aspects to most negotiations.

- `NOt a chess player? nothing to fear` -- You’ll do well to think of negotiating as a game, like a chess game, as you approach it. But again, unlike and beyond chess, it is often not about how well you calculate that determines the outcome, but how well you communicate and work with your counterparty. It’s about how you satisfy your counterparty’s needs while also taking care of your own. Unlike chess, it is often possible and always desirable to get the counterparty on your side, to work effectively and amicably with your counterpart

- `positional and win-win negotiating` -- Although several forms of negotiation will be discussed in this book, the two most common are positional negotiating and win-win negotiating. Particularly in today’s fast-paced and heavily interconnected world, of these two types of negotiation you should embrace win-win negotiation as the more useful approach.

  Positional negotiating occurs when each side takes a position and is hesitant to yield, or yield much, to the other. Each side is committed to its course of action—hopefully, but not always, for a business reason. Business reasons can mean things like budget or cost constraints, design constraints, specific customer needs that must be met, and so forth.
  
  But often—too often, really—one side takes, and tries to keep, a tough position for personal reasons: ego, a “win-at-all-costs” or “win-lose” mentality
  
  always ask yourself: “Is there a business reason why I’m doing this?”

  In positional negotiations, both sides become so focused on their own needs that they fail to comprehend those of the other party. A power struggle often ensues and the parties never really get around to discussing their goals and objective
  
  In short: don’t be a “tough guy.” It only makes things harder, and in today’s competitive environment, your counterparties may simply walk.


- `Win win Negotiation` -- nstead of positional negotiation, which is really win-lose in the end, you can—and should—try to engage in a win-win style and strategy. Win-win means that both parties come away satisfied such that their needs, or at least most of their needs, are addressed and met. When both sides come away with items they want and need, agreements are made more easily, take less time, and preserve or even enhance the long-term relationship between parties—important in business as well as in personal situations

  Being successful at win-win negotiating means getting good at understanding and anticipating your counterparty’s needs; it also means being a bit more flexible with your own needs and wants in order to hammer out the collaborative solution. Playing fair—being up front and honest about your needs and your responses to theirs—is also important.

  In most cases, the successful negotiation starts with a win-win end in mind. Ultimately, win-win negotiation is almost always a gratifying way to do business. It should be no surprise that much of the remainder of this book is constructed around the idea of win-win negotiation.

# WHEN THEY DONT WANT TO PLAY

- You want to make a deal to pave your parking lot or fix the roof on your building or procure 5,000 custom integrated circuits to build into your product. You reach out to contact your favorite supplier, but he doesn’t return your phone call right away. You wait a few days. He doesn’t return your phone call at all. You think your need and the business deal is pretty straightforward, and you think you have a pretty good relationship with these suppliers and contractors. So what’s going on?

  The first step is to simply find out why. Follow up with a phone call, leave a message if necessary simply asking why they aren’t prepared to negotiate with you. There may be a simple explanation. Maybe the counterparty doesn’t have the time to do the work or even negotiate just yet but would be willing to work with you at a later date.
  
  If the reason why remains elusive, find out the “what” or “how.” What can you put forth in order to make your request to negotiate more attractive? What can you put forth to make the negotiation quicker or easier? Can you throw some other business their way to make it more attractive? Can you be flexible with deadlines or project staging to allow the counterparty to work in other projects? If you can, you’re likely to get a better deal. If you can’t, you may stir up the stinging bees of a positional negotiation—or just as bad, continue to be ignored altogether.
  
  Bottom line: it doesn’t hurt to make or suggest a few concessions right in the beginning. You want to get the counterparty to the table, and you want to get them to the table feeling positive.
