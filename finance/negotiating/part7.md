# FINALIZING THE DEAL

- Okay, here’s another scenario: The negotiation has worked and you’re almost there! Step back, taking a break if necessary, to review all points of the negotiation against your list of goals, musts, and wants.

- `when is the deal a deal` -- From a legal standpoint, closure occurs when all the agreed-upon terms are finalized into a clear, binding, signed contract, witnessed and verified by all parties. Read the entire agreement, and sign only when you’re ready. The less you can leave open to interpretation, the better.

- `last minute concessions` -- When the close isn’t going as smoothly as hoped, and the other party is still unable to accept the conditions as they stand, you might want to offer a last-minute concession to push the deal into completion. Not a big one that changes the whole deal—but one that is worth something to them. This gesture shows a willingness to sacrifice something to make the deal work for both of you. Getting things done now may well be worth more than the value of the minor concession.
Again, don’t make this last-minute concession a centerpiece of the negotiation.

# START WITH THE END IN MIND FOR THE CLOSE, TOO

- Remember, closing is a separate step that requires as much diligence as the other steps. You should never rush through it. Here are the closing checkpoints you should be sure you follow through on
  - First, confirm that everyone is in agreement that it’s time to close. If there are still large disagreements, open issues, or items of research to be done, it probably isn’t time to close.
  - Review the agenda to be sure everything has been covered.
  - Review your notes, including agreements and concessions, to verify coverage and completion of all terms and conditions.
  - Create to-do lists, if needed, for items to follow up on. Delegate those items to team members and provide clear deadlines for follow-up.
  - Make a clear transition to the close. Tell the team that’s where they are and set a mini-agenda for the close itself: what items still need to be discussed and where and how the final agreement will emerge.

# FINALIZING THE AGREEMENT

- You’ve worked hard. You’ve found the win-win that gives both parties a sense of success. You’ve outlined the terms of the deal; who does what, where, when, and how. Both parties have agreed to the deal at a high level and at a level of detail sufficient to proceed.

  Now what? You need to document the deal. You need to get it in writing, first, so everyone knows the terms and what to do to meet them; and second, so that you have something to refer back to in case anything isn’t clear or gets lost in the fog of time. Just as important for most deals (perhaps excluding deals with your teenage son) is that you document them so as to make them legally binding. Legal documents make sure that expectations are clear and that remedies are available in case certain terms aren’t adhered to.
  
   I can’t include an entire course in business law in a single chapter, nor can I provide you with legal counsel in this book. However, I can give you some basics to be aware of as you proceed and as you seek the advice of specialists in creating and enforcing the deal.

# ELEMENTS OF AN AGREEMENT

- I will use the words agreement and contract somewhat interchangeably here; the basics are the same except that a contract is more formal and is typically written using a boilerplate form with all the appropriate legal language and disclosure

- `types of contracts` -- Contracts serve to record agreements that two or more parties have made with each other and to outline the terms of those agreements. A good contract protects the promises, expectations, and investments of the parties involved, and if done right, is sufficient to be enforced such that disputes can be resolved in a court of law.
Contracts can range from a simple template form (perhaps downloaded from an online source) to specific custom-written documents that are tailored to the specific deal.

- `form contracts` -- Form or boilerplate contracts are precrafted templates used for basic, oft-repeated agreements. Most real estate agencies and mortgage brokers will use the same form contract for every client. These boilerplates list the conditions, limitations, and delivery expectations agreed to, and they are amended only to reflect the terms and provisions unique to each situation. The set-in-stone appearance of this type of contract may seem intimidating, but you can change the form, to add or delete items as needed, so long as both parties agree and accept the changes

# THE THREE MAIN PARTS OF A CONTRACT

- At its roots, a contract has three major and clearly identifiable parts: the offer, the consideration, and the
acceptance. The offer is straightforward: “We at Company A will produce and deliver 1,000 widgets per month for the next six months.” The consideration is the payment: “Company B will pay $25 per widget, with a discount of 1 percent if paid within thirty days.” The acceptance is the signed return of that agreement with any other agreed-to terms that come in along the way.

- `drafting agreements and contracts` -- As the negotiation winds down, the next decision is who will draft the agreement. Then you need to decide who will take responsibility for finalizing the contract. Make sure everyone agrees on who leads these tasks

  The first step in drafting an agreement is to summarize the notes, be it a single set of notes taken by a single scribe or negotiation leader or a composite of several sets of notes. If the notes aren’t sufficient, you may have to go back to revisit certain negotiation points; take the time to do so. Otherwise you risk having crucial details left out, muddled, misconstrued, or denied. Notes should include, or reference, the specific terms and benefits for both you and the counterparty, including deliverables, consideration, and timing, including:
  - All terms and details of the agreemen
  - Conditions on which those terms are based
  - Referenced material, such as price lists, warranty information, or insurance policies
  - Important deadlines—both yours and the counterparty’s
  - Costs, prices, percentages, and other terms and conditions
  - Remedies for nonperformance or altered performance
  - Terms for terminating and/or renegotiating the contract

- `why volunteer to write the agreement ?` -- In his book, The Negotiation Toolkit: How to Get Exactly What You Want in Any Business or Personal Situation, Roger J. Volkema suggests that offering to write up the agreement benefits you in two ways. First, it relieves the other party of the task and can be viewed as gracious and generous. Second—and more important—writing the agreement gives you some control over what it says and how it says it.Whether or not a lawyer writes the contract, a brief review from a lawyer is usually a good idea.

- `are verbal contracts enforcable` -- It’s a critical question in today’s rapid business context. Many contracts can come about from a simple phone call or golf course conversation. State laws vary, but the baseline answer is “yes,” verbal contracts are enforceable in most states. 

  Naturally, it helps to document the terms of the deal after the verbal agreement; otherwise enforcement can be difficult. I
  
- `getting the deatils right`-
  - `contegencies` -- In addition, you should understand what happens if something unexpected occurs. If there’s a fire and the production facility is damaged before the job is done, how will you proceed? Will the contract become null and void?
  - `consideration` -- Consideration is a fancy term for tangible compensation or promises. As a standard principle of contract law, a contract is only legal and valid if something of value is exchanged for something else of value and both parties agree on all the terms. Even further, some states require that consideration must be in writing in order for the contract to be considered legally binding.
Consideration includes any form of compensation—usually cash but it can be other tangible items. As a general principle, you must do something for the other party to be able to require the other party to something for you or else it isn’t really a contract.
  - `contract review` -- When the time comes to finalize the contract, careful review is important. It is a good idea to have an impartial colleague and/or attorney go over it for details

# EXPECTING THE UNEXPECTED

- `whitdrawing from the contract` -- Most of us have experienced buyer’s remorse. You find something you like, buy it, then change your mind. When you enter into a business contract, a lot depends on what the other party is willing to do. If you want to get out of the contract, the other party might allow it in order to maintain the integrity of the relationship. Maybe there was an oversight or something unexpected happened and your counterparty feels that cutting you loose is a better choice than enforcing the contract. Though your counterparty may empathize with your reasons for wanting to cancel the contract, they’re not obliged to let you do it.

# WHAT CAN VOID A CONTRACT

- Contract law generally holds that contracts can be invalidated under certain conditions where willful misrepresentation has occurred. Essentially, being fully up front and truthful is best, although a bit of salesperson’s hyperbole or exaggeration on more subjective attributes (“These widgets are the best you can buy!”) won’t get you into too much trouble.

- `good faith or bad faith` -- When a counterparty makes concessions they don’t intend to live up to, they are acting in bad faith; a deal can be rendered null and void if bad faith is judged to be extensively present enough to influence the outcome of the negotiation.

- `misinterpresentation and duress` -- If the other party tells you something he knows is false, and you sign the contract based on your belief that his statement is true, you can have the contract rescinded in court. The same holds true even if the other party was unaware that the information was false. Keep in mind that if you have the contract canceled, you’ll be required to give back any consideration you received. This includes money, products, keys to the company car, and warranties, to name a few.
Similarly, if you signed a contract under duress (at gunpoint is the extreme example, or perhaps while seriously ill) the contract won’t be considered a legal document. A contract can only be valid if both parties willingly agree to its terms. It cannot be enforced if one party is made to do something he would not have done under ordinary conditions.

- `fraud` -- According to the Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law, the legal definition of fraud is “an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of obtaining some valuable thing or promise from another.” Similar to misrepresentation, fraud is an act in which a person presents false information, causing a counterparty to suffer a loss. The differences: fraud is intentional, and it is a criminal offense.

- `resolving a dispute` -- Sometimes a misunderstanding simply won’t go away, and the specter of litigation enters the picture. Filing a lawsuit is a decision that shouldn’t be made in haste, and legal advice is important at this point. The litigation process differs state by state and is beyond the scope of this book. Nonetheless, here are a few processes that can help you to bypass formal litigation as a solution to resolving agreement and contract disputes.
  - alternative dispute resolutions
  - negotiation and settlement
  - mediation
  - arbitration

# NEGOTIATING FOR THE LONG TERM: REMEMBER ITS ALL ABOUT TRUST

- As in many aspects of life, both personal and professional, establishing and maintaining trust is a key baseline to doing anything else. Put differently, without trust, you might still win the negotiation, but it will be so much harder. Trust pushes a lot of the negative aside in a relationship, while no trust puts the negative front and center. For this reason, building and establishing trust should be one of your first and foremost goals, both at work and outside of it.

> say what you'll do, do what you say

Outside of the golden rule (treat others as you wish to be treated yourself), I can’t think of nine other more prescient and important words to describe a successful modus operandi in life. Say what you’re going to do and do what you say consistently, and how could people not trust you?

# CREATING LASTING RELATIONSHIPS

- `the "A" list -- Perhaps it is obvious by now, but every negotiation you’ll be engaged in involves roughly the same set of key skills and steps. You can set up a simple grading chart covering just a handful of items. What follows is an example of a short chart you might use to grade or score your performance in a negotiation:
  - You “saw” the negotiation: its preparation, start, middle, and finish.
  - You prepared the right—and right amount of—information, including product attributes, competitive environment, etc.
  - You “knew” the counterparty and what she or he was looking for.
  - You got the deal done.
  - You achieved your objectives and goals.
  - You came up with a win-win.
  - You have a good idea of what went right and what went wrong.
  - You learned from your mistakes.
  - You advanced the relationship with these negotiators.
  - You advanced your personal and professional reputation.
  
  You won’t get straight A’s the first time around; nobody does. But over time your grades will inevitably improve.
