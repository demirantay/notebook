# THE TACTICAL TOOLKIT

- Be it a five-minute or a five-day affair, you’re in the final stages of preparing for the negotiation. You’ve covered all the bases of preparation—visualizing the outcome, preparing the facts, and anticipating the style and tactics of your counterparty. Strategically, you’re ready.

  Now, as a finalizing stage of your preparation, it’s time to review the tactical toolkit also note that these tactical ploys should be used in moderation. Subtle is best

— you don’t want to gain the reputation of being a manipulative negotiator. The idea is to manipulate without your counterparty being aware of it.

# TACTICS _ IN CONTEXT

- in today’s fast-paced world it’s even more important to recognize and deal with these tactics and ploys in real time. You won’t have a lot of time to analyze; rather, you’ll have to know negotiating types and their tactics so well that you can instinctively recognize them as they occur over the board

- `good-cop bad-cop` -- Easily recognized in most cases, the good cop–bad cop ploy is a sometimes-entertaining display of two people on the same team playing opposite roles in an effort to distort the counterparty’s perception of events and control their emotions. The bad cop is disagreeable—tough minded, unreasonable, maybe irritable and angry. The good cop, on the other hand, is calm and helpful, the peacemaker or collaborator who interjects perhaps to tell the abrasive personality to ease up a little, even creating the impression of helping you.

  Behavioral economists have long noted our tendency to accept deals once a higher price, or decoy, is shown. This is because we feel we’ve gotten a better deal because we’ve avoided the “bad” one advanced by the bad cop.
  
- `counteracting the good cop-bad cop ploy` -- It’s not hard to identify this tactic, and there are several ways to deal with it:
  - Say you want to negotiate with the good cop only.
  - Threaten to end the negotiation. The bad cop may back down, and the good cop may take over.
  - Roll out the same ploy. Bring your own bad cop into it. Tell them you’d be more than happy to agree to their demands, but you have a supervisor who never bends the rules.
  - Speak to the good cop privately. Once alone, tell him you’re about to walk away from this negotiation because of the bad cop’s behavior, position, or even lack of professionalism. Do it on a break, or give the good cop time to discuss your needs privately with his team.
  
- `shills and decoys` -- In the marketing and selling world, shills are specially placed people who act as bait to lure customers— and in our case, negotiating counterparties. Shills are commonly used in auctions. The shill is a false or fake bidder who is there to put in higher bids. The hope is that you, a legitimate participant, will see the “value” of the item and bid higher. In a casino, you might see someone stationed at a slot machine or table winning over and over. This too-lucky person isn’t gambling, he’s working for the house.

  Again, some preplanning and good teamwork are usually prerequisites, although to an experienced negotiating team some may occur on the fly. The shill can consist of “expert” testimony by a current user of the product or service, someone who appears happy (and may well be) with the deal he got.
A typical ploy is to position something as a “must” (like a certain price point) when it is really a “want”; the “must” becomes a limit in the counterparty’s mind that feels good when you finally move away from it. “Well, okay, I have a $50 dress shirt on the sale table that’s almost as good,” you might say. In this light, the $50 shirt may seem like a good option when an $80 shirt is the only alternative choice. In such cases, the more expensive shirt is playing the role of decoy

  A clothing salesperson may use accessories, shoes, or adjacent items as decoys: “Oh by the way, I’ve got some great ties and shoes on sale over here.” Such a statement is designed to give you, the customer, a stronger sense of the value for the deal overall. It also diverts your focus away from the main topic—the
$80 shirt and its high price. If the sideline deals really are good, you might get a good feeling from those

  deals. As a result, you might be more willing to fork over $80 for the dress shirt.
  
- `counteracting the shill and decoy` -- The best way to play defense against this ploy is to see it coming. See “experts” and “expert testimonies” for what they really are. Evaluate each deal or price point based on its own merits. Try not to be overly influenced by the adjacent deal. See decoys for what they are—sophisticated distractions and emotional appeals to get you away from your normal sense of economic value.

- `the strawman technique` -- The straw man technique is a ploy to make the counterparty believe something has more value than it really does. The counterparty induces a concession because a negotiating point appears to be important, even though that’s not the case. It is similar to a decoy but more likely to be conceived and put into play during the course of the negotiation rather than thought out beforehand.
  
  The best way to explain this ploy is by example. Suppose that during the negotiation to buy a house you decide you would like to include the washer and dryer in the deal. The sellers recognize an opportunity since they were planning to buy a new washer and dryer and leave the old ones anyway. But now they have some additional bargaining power because they know you want them. Rather than simply saying, “Sure. We didn’t want to take them with us anyway,” they display concern about letting these machines go and say, “Well, maybe . . . if you’re willing to throw in a couple hundred extra toward our closing costs.” They’ve made an apparent concession to you, but in fact they’ve used the washer and dryer as a straw man—a feature or item of little value to them—to extract a concession from you.
  
  One defense against the straw man tactic is to return the favor. The buyer might say, “You’re taking the washer and dryer to your new home? Well, I would like the Sub-Zero fridge” (you really don’t, but it’s a tactic to get them to reconsider their position on the washer and dryer). Give them alternatives: “If you leave the washer/dryer, it will be so much less work.” Or: “You need more time to decide? How can I help you reach the decision more quickly?” You can also ask questions about motives and call their bluff: “Were you really planning to take that old washer and dryer to the new house? The new ones are so much better.”
  
- `taken by suprise` -- No doubt you’ve experienced this one in your personal life if not in your professional one: An unexpected twist in the negotiation throws you off guard and switches you from relying on facts to reacting based on emotion. From there, concessions can be more easily forthcoming!

  Let’s reverse roles and make you the person taking your counterparty by surprise. You throw out a surprise negotiating point (“Did you know that we’re about to make the last production run on the widget you’re looking to order?”) or show a little frustration or anger about a point that she’s making. The intent is to break her concentration, put her on the defensive, knock her off balance, or even put her into a panic if she really depends on your widgets. Once her guard is down, it will be easier for you to ask for what you want
  
  Do not react. Since that’s exactly what the other party is hoping for, do not give in to the ploy. Stay calm and show your professionalism.
Take a break. Give yourself time to cool off or to let the new information sink in.
	Ask for details. Learn as much as you can about the new information you’ve just been given, and determine if it’s truly something to be worried about.
	Call for help. If the other party introduces new information to the negotiation and you’re not prepared to handle it, convene your team to discuss how to handle the new information.
  
- `add=ons and nibbling` -- Add-ons and nibbling are two commonly used tactics you’ll see over and over. An add-on is a small incremental point or concession that a negotiator adds to the end of a larger concession that’s already being discussed. For example, “I’ll buy your product if you throw in a free one-year warranty.” Nibbling is a variant of the add-on, usually saved for the end of the negotiation, the “one last thing” asked for after a mutually beneficial agreement is reached.

  In the case of nibbling, the timing is such that nobody wants to reopen the negotiation

# THE SHORT LIST OF OTHER TACTICS

- Here are a few other common negotiating tricks and ploys you’ll see—and may use—from time to time:

- `Funny money`. Funny money is real money presented in a way that makes it seem less real. When gambling, you exchange cash for chips, a tactic casinos employ to make customers feel as if they’re not gambling with real money. In negotiating, the other party may use funny money

- `Red Herring` -- A red herring is a glaring decoy or straw man. A negotiator might enter a negotiation with a huge request—a ten-year warranty—in hopes of getting a one-year warranty or some other major concession. He never expected the ten-year warranty in the first place, but he did want to change the balance of power in the negotiation.

- `Low-balling` -- You may hear a one-time offer or concession that goes away as you get into the details of the negotiation. You hear a great price, but then start to hear about the various conditions (“Well, that price is only good on the first Tuesday after a full moon”)

- `FLinching` -- A variant of Taken by Surprise, a counterparty throws an “out-of-the-ballpark” price or term into the agreement just to gauge your reaction. You flinch—and the degree of your flinch is used as the starting point to find something you can agree on.

- `Crunch` -- The negotiator—particularly the intimidator—uses this tactic to make you doubt your position by rejecting your entire offer, using terms like, “You’ll have to do much better than that” or “That’s just not good enough for me. To defend against this tactic, ask a lot of “why” questions about the reasons the terms you’ve proposed aren’t good enough; you may find that the objections to them disappear quickly.

- `Bogey` -- A bogey is used as a third-party scapegoat, some kind of immovable object that prevents flexibility in a deal. As an example, the counterparty might blame her manager or some internal rule for why she cannot bring down certain fees. When you detect a bogey, ask a lot of questions or even to speak to the person if it is a person. If it’s a rule, ask to read the rule. Get to the authority behind the bogey when you can.

# WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE THE UNDERDOG 

- Aside from the specific tactics described in the previous sections, it is helpful to carry some more general strategies and tactics in your negotiator’s toolkit for dealing with situations when the balance of power is decidedly not in your favor.

  Both sides typically have strengths and weaknesses that can be used to their advantage to create win-win solutions that work across the table. In the real world, however, for a variety of reasons you might find yourself in a position of unequal power or leverage.

  Suppose the other party has a prestigious reputation, is a long-acknowledged expert on the topic, has superior negotiating skills, and has a stellar team backing him up. You have none of these advantages, making you the underdog in the negotiations. You can still do well, but you’ll need to prepare more. Here are some tactics to deal with being an underdog:
  - Recognize the situation. Don’t be intimidated by those credentials—they don’t ultimately affect the win-win.
  - Figure out where you can acquire leverage. Bring in experts of your own, take a careful inventory of your capabilities and find a unique value proposition different from the competition.
  - 	Research what you don’t know. If lack of knowledge about the issues makes you the underdog, take it upon yourself to bridge the gap.
  - Be confident. Walk into the negotiation as if you couldn’t possibly fail. Don’t cave—no matter how strong or unpleasant your counterparty might turn out to be
  
- `if you are not ready` -- Simply put, if you’re not ready to negotiate, don’t. Maybe you need more time to prepare, or maybe you need more information from the other party; whatever the reason, do what you can to avoid putting yourself in a position you’ll regret later. Let your counterparty know as soon as possible that you’re not ready; see if you can agree on another date. Offer an alternative and be as precise as possible so the counterparty doesn’t get the impression you’re procrastinating. If the situation is difficult, remember the win-win paradigm—you want to win, and the other party deserves to win, too. Remind your counterparty of this philosophy. You should give—and ask for— enough time to prepare to come to the table with a reasonable and equal chance to win. If he can’t live up to this principle, then he may not be fit to do business with in the long term anyway.
