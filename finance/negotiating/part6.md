# ALLOWING STRESS TO TAKE OVER

- `the big secret: preparation` -- I can sum up the best antidote for stress and anxiety in one word: preparation. When you’re prepared, you know what you’re talking about, and when you know what you’re talking about, you deliver it well. When you deliver it well, the anxiety goes away. This cycle of confidence does more to alleviate stress than any breathing exercise, handholding, medication, or any other tool or crutch possibly can.
We’ve already covered preparation (see Chapter 3), so there’s no need to repeat it here. But just as real-estate agents talk about the “three Ls” most important in real estate, “location, location, and location,” I submit that the “three Ps” of successful negotiatio

# MANHANDLING CONCESSIONS 

- Remember—when making concessions, always ask for something in return. And remember, timing can be everything.
You might think it to be a good gesture to give away something because you figure you can ask for something in return later. Problem is, the later never really happens, or you feel compelled to give away something else when it comes. If you haven’t been keeping track of concessions, you’ll fail to see what you’ve given away and what you’ve received. You may also have to backtrack and re-evaluate the issues under discussion at the time you originally gave up the concession.

- `get it in writing` -- Always keep track of key points, decisions, and concessions in a negotiation. It will help you track what’s happened, what’s been given and received, and what further actions are necessary. Like a court record, written documentation provides a handy reference for everyone involved, and it makes drawing up an agreement a heck of a lot easier.

# HIGH PRESSURE NEGOTIATING TACTICS

- As we’ve touched on in earlier chapters, negotiators can use numerous tactics and ploys to divert your attention away from the main facts and issues in a negotiation. Small tactical and emotional ploys can distract you, appeal to your emotions, or otherwise redirect the flow of exchange from task-oriented matters to more personal considerations. The usual antidote is to see these tactics coming and to calmly redirect the negotiation back to the objective high ground.
  
  But there are several more outsized tactics and ploys to discuss, which I will refer to as high-pressure tactics, that are designed to force a counterparty to make hurried or seat-of-the-pants decisions out of fear of losing the deal altogether. These maneuvers can take the form of competitive offers, real and imaginary deadlines, and various kinds of ultimatums, all of which give the impression of leaving little room for further negotiation

# THE UNREALISTIC FIRST OFFER

- You walk into the negotiating venue. You take off your coat, exchange pleasantries, turn on your laptop, turn off your phone, sit down, and get down to business. Barely started, you blurt out the first offer: “We will sell you 1,000 widgets at $25,” knowing full well you’re prepared to deal them at $15 each.
Making an unrealistic first offer is one way to get a “feel” for how much (or how little) the counterparty is willing to take or to give you. You drop the offer on the table, then read the counterparty’s response. First, based on their expression—anger, dissatisfaction, surprise, composure, or eagerness— you can get an idea about what is acceptable or within the scope of what they’re willing to further negotiate

- `playing defense` -- Of course, if you’re on the receiving end of such an arm-twisting offer, your best defense is to be prepared. Know the market, and know what is in and out of bounds. Don’t be afraid to display this knowledge to the counterparty. You’ll gain their respect and head off their ability to use other such ploys.

  Another way to play defense is to avoid getting an unrealistic offer altogether by being the one to make the first offer. This tactic also allows you to secure the starting point for the negotiation. Be careful not to put yourself at a disadvantage by making too generous an offer. Make it an informed—but slightly aggressive—offer. Remember that it’s only a starting point.

# THE "ONE TIME ONLY" OFFER

- As a consumer, you get this one all the time. “Buy today, get 30 percent off.” But today, and today only. What do you do? The impulse is to buy today—often whether you really need it or not—just to get the good deal

- `playing defense` -- Again, the best way to counter this ploy is to keep your cool and stay informed. Let your information and preparation guide you. Decide when you’re ready to decide. Take your time, and make a little more time, by taking breaks or negotiating a little “bend” into the “firm” delivery date offer. Take the time (and ask for it if necessary) to do more research, ask questions, make sure the offer is consistent with your goals, and consult with your team.

  As with the unrealistic offer, you can also ignore the tactic altogether. When the other party introduces the one-time only offer into the discussion, sidestep it (perhaps ignoring it altogether) by continuing to discuss ongoing issues or even bringing up some new ones. This passive-aggressive technique buys some time and likely attenuates your own emotional response

# SCARCITY AND DELAY OF GAME

Everyone has experienced this ploy in daily life. You go to the store to get a good sale price on an item, say a new high-definition TV. The salesperson calmly extolls the virtues of the TV—then calmly tells you that there are only two left, and when they’re gone they’re gone.

- `playing defense` -- When you suspect that the scarcity ploy is in play, the best approach is to ask questions to verify the scarcity. Try to determine if it is real: “Are there more of these TVs in the back? On order? Available online?” Also seek an alternative: “If I don’t buy this TV today, what other televisions might offer nearly the same functionality at the same price?” You might find that there are plenty of alternatives and that a BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) will emerge—the scarcity of that model is real but not a big enough factor to get you to rush into a decision.

# FALSE BOTTOM LINES AND FALSE CONCESSIONS

- Here are two other negotiation ploys you see come up from time to time: the false bottom line and the false concession.

- `the false bottom line ploy` -- This one’s common, too. If you are a parent, chances are you probably deploy it from time to time: the conveyance of a false or “absolute” bottom line beyond which you cannot go. “I can’t buy you that $400 bicycle. You’ll have to settle for the $350 one.” Of course, you can spend $400 on a bike; you just choose not to.

  In business, the false bottom lines are more subtle and tend to be driven more by external “reasons.” For example, “I can’t give you the $14 price on those widgets because my boss won’t allow it; you’ll have to take the $15 deal.”
  
- `playing defense` -- If you suspect a false bottom line, the first step is to probe its veracity; find out whether it’s true or false. Ask what the limiting manager actually said, when, and why. Next, look at the deal as a “whole” deal and—if the price is firm at $15—ask if there are other concessions such as delivery, warranty, service and support, or other deliverables that can bring more value to your side of the table even if the price is firm. You may want to prepare a few concessions of your own. You’ll get a better deal, and you might even get the price to move as the counterparty realizes that a price concession might be easier than some other concession.
Bottom line: when they throw a “bottom line” at you, the negotiation isn’t over. In fact, it may have just begun.

# COMPETITION AND DEADLINES

- `the competititon ploy` -- Here, real competition or competitive offerings are used as a type of shill in the negotiation. This tactic works, for example, when trying to choose a cell phone carrier. You might visit several wireless providers to hear their offers. When you find one that seems to suit you best, mention that you also looked into Company B and were quoted a rate that you’re seriously considering. Nine times out of ten, you’ll get another offer right away. Simply continue this approach until the best deal presents itself.

- `palying defnese` -- Suppose the roles reverse; your counterparty is presenting several competitive options to get a better deal out of you. You feel the pressure. However, you may or may not know what the competitors actually offer (if you’re prepared, you will know!). If you’re not completely up to speed on the competitors, ask for some details on the other offers. Find out if there’s a “value proposition” where some other feature, such as data service or reception coverage, is diminished in order to produce the good price. If the counterparty doesn’t know, he may have been bluffing all along; if he does know, you’ll learn a lot more about the competition

# LAST MINUTE OFFERS AND WITHOLDING INFORMATION

- Just about when you’re ready to close your laptop and close the deal, you hear, “Wait! We’ve got another counteroffer for you!” Of course, what is your frame of mind at that point? You’re done—that’s what.
When you’re finished or close to finished with anything—say, that college term paper or final exams— the last thing you want to do is to revisit it all. You’d be willing to give something, anything, not to have to revise that term paper. So what are you likely to do? Concede something, just to keep it done. That, of course, is what your counterparty seeks.

- `playing defense` -- This ploy is hard to defend against, because you don’t know what may be coming at the last minute. If your counterparty has done this before, of course, you can say something about it as you lay out the “ground rules” for this latest negotiation. You can also ask for an extended deadline. This delay gives you time to regroup and get back into the negotiating frame of mind: You want to prevent yourself from acting too hastily in an emotional attempt not to scotch a done deal.

- `the witholding information ploy` -- Somewhat similar to the last-minute offer, a counterparty may wait until the deadline is near to disclose additional information, leaving you little time to digest the new details. He wants to see if you’ll give in without fully absorbing the new information completely

- `playing defense` -- The defense is simple: Ask for more time. Keep your balance; judge objectively. In order to restore equilibrium, you may also take some of your concessions off the table or disclose some new information of your own for the counterparty to consider.

# CLOSING THE DEAL: SOLVING UNEQUAL BARGANING PROBLEMS

- If the negotiation has been smooth up to this point, the terms and concessions should be fairly easy to document and to spin up into a deal. If there’s time, and if good notes have been taken as you go, the negotiating team “scribe” can document all elements of the deal on the spot, draw up the final agreement, and get the necessary approvals or signatures, real or virtual, on the spot.
  
  If the deal negotiated so far stops short of win-win, there may be more work to do. It’s usually okay to come out a little ahead, but when the deal seems too one-sided, problems will creep in, ranging from immediate (dis)approval from superiors, advisors, or legal teams to damaging the long-term relationship between you and the counterparty
  
- `fix the win lose outcome` -- Win-lose deals come about when strong positional negotiating tactics are used, often marked by emotional ploys, aggressive behaviors, poor preparation, and/or tight deadlines. Win-lose deals happen when counterparties dig in too deeply and fail to work toward the win-win. Such stubbornness and reluctance to “lose” comes about out of shortsightedness and, in many cases, ego. The negotiation has become as much about personal gain as it has about business or objective gain. Goals and objectives on one or both sides won’t be met.

  The best way to deal with this situation is to stop. Pause the negotiation and exercise some leadership, reaffirm the win-win goal, and take inventory of what each side has won and lost. Remind everyone at the table that short-term and long-term success is couched in a win-win deal. The size of the wins doesn’t have to be equal, but both sides should achieve something toward their goals.
  
- `knowing when to opt out` -- Sometimes, no matter how much time you’ve invested into making a deal work, you reach a point where it feels like it’s time to walk away. The reasons might be readily apparent—you’re not satisfied with the final offer, you have new information, you’re uncomfortable with the other party and their tactics, one (or more) alternative deals seem better, or you want to research a better alternative.

  The reasons could be more subtle, psychological, or intuitive. For example, if your counterparty has been difficult to work with or untrustworthy from the beginning, you’ll wonder about dealing with this person or organization through the life of the contract; his behavior may not improve. You may also not want to negotiate with him again.
  
  When it feels like the counterparty is being especially difficult or is not seeking the win-win, withdrawing from the negotiation not only saves time, stress, and sometimes money, but it also sends a message: You’re too far apart, factually or emotionally, to continue. Most likely, if there is a win-win somewhere in sight, the counterparty will come back to the table. If the counterparty doesn’t come back, you may assume that it wouldn’t have worked anyway.
