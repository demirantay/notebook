# PREPARATION, PREAPARATION, PREPERATION

- Public speakers say that the secret to success is preparation. Their advice: “Prepare one hour for every minute of the speech.” Why? Not only to know the material but also to build confidence. You benefit when you channel all that loose energy and nervousness into confidence. And then when you deliver your speech you appear “better” than the audience because you know your stuff.

  It works. And such a mantra is easily ported over to the world of negotiation. Be prepared and you’ll know your stuff.This can’t be stressed enough: prepare, prepare and prepare.

# PREPARING THE GROUND

- win-win isn’t the only strategy, and it doesn’t begin to cover the topic of tactics. As the saying goes, the “devil is in the details.” You must not only know your stuff but, like a good game-player, you must also be able to envision your moves—sometimes several moves in advance—to keep the game going your way

  This in turn requires preparation. It’s not just about the rules of the game per se. It’s about developing a thorough understanding of the question at hand, the topic of the negotiation. It’s about knowing the facts, understanding the nuanced “gray areas” and unknowns around the facts, understanding your team, understanding your counterparty, and even being familiar with the very “ground” or venue in which the negotiation will occur. Any shortfall in preparation in any of these areas can create awkwardness—which in turn may create weaknesses your opponent can exploit
  
- `start with the end in mind` -- The essence is “seeing” the outcome. Try to imagine what a finished deal will look like, then work backward through the negotiation process, the back and forth, the give and take, all the way to the facts and information you’ll bring into the negotiation. Of course, you can’t visualize everything, but the vision will help you organize your thoughts and be better prepared to cover the gaps—the unknowns—when they come into view.

  In contrast, if you walk into a negotiation unprepared, unsure, and undecided on what you hope to achieve, the counterparty—especially if a seasoned negotiator—will seize upon this opportunity to dominate the negotiation and make it all about her needs.
  
- `visualizing the outcome` -- To help determine the “end in mind” you want, you might start setting goals and strategies by asking yourself the following questions:
  - What do I hope to achieve in the negotiation?
  - What is my main goal? The best outcome?
  - What are my secondary goals?
  - What are my “musts” and “wants”?
  - What can prevent me from being successful?
  - What are the likely specific stumbling blocks?
  - How can I overcome these stumbling blocks?
  - What preparatory steps can I take to make the negotiation quick and successful?
  
  Obviously these questions are at a very general level and can be modified according to the specifics of the negotiation. But they’re a good place to start.

# KNOW YOUR MUSTS AND WANTS

- Almost every negotiation will have a primary goal or goals, and secondary goals. Primary, or main, goals represent the main item(s) you want to accomplish or achieve in the negotiation; secondary goals, which are usually many in number, are just that—important but not as important as the main goal. Often they are attributes of the item being negotiated as the main goal.

  Your main goal should be the driving force behind your negotiating position. ou should prepare to give up less-important wants as part of your overall negotiating strategy. If it’s a “must” or a very strong “want,” then you need to prepare for what you might give up for it.

  This seems kind of obvious, but I’ve seen negotiators break down completely over something that isn’t really that important in the grand scheme of the negotiation. They wanted a blue car, but was it worth giving up a deal on a fantastic low-mileage cream puff to attain? In the end, no.
  
- `know your limitations and weakneses` -- Given half a glass of water on the table, some of us naturally see it as half full, some of us as half empty. Negotiating thrives on confidence—the ability to be positive, steady, strong, and sure about your subject because you’re well prepared—seeing the glass half full. But part of the preparation for the negotiation is also knowing your weak (empty) spots and limitations.

  As you visualize the negotiation, you should take inventory on what parts of the deal might be hard for you to deliver on or accept. We’ve all been there, trying to buy airline tickets three days before we want to travel while still trying to get a low fare. That short notice puts us in a weak negotiating position
  
- `Limitations—How Far You Will or Won’t Go` -- ust like at an auction, it’s easy to get caught up in the emotional frenzy of a negotiation and agree to something you wouldn’t have without the pressures of the moment. It’s human nature, and we’ve all experienced it. You may have gone into a negotiation prepared to spend no more than $10,000 for a car, but come away spending $10,500 because you found one with exactly what you wanted and couldn’t pass it up. If you have the extra $500, no big deal. But it might also break your budget, causing no amount of embarrassment, not to mention concessions on your side, when you are forced to backtrack.

  The right approach is to set limitations—minimums, maximums—before you enter the negotiation. Set limitations before you go in—and make sure everyone on your team knows and understands them.

# PLNANING FOR AND USING CONCESSIONS

- As you’re visualizing the negotiation, keep in mind that the ability to be flexible may serve to your advantage at some point during the negotiation. While you don’t want to easily give up any of your goals or compromise on your limitations, you do want to keep an open mind about how you can adjust your negotiating points if it means a mutual agreement can be reached.

  Concessions can be used as adjustments to the negotiation. Concessions are small gives and takes to help both parties arrive at the best win-win solution; they are refinements to the deal
  
  Some experts believe you should always make the first concession. By taking the initiative this way, you retain control over the ones most important to you. Other experts feel that letting the other party make the first concession allows you to take the prize if they overbid. Eventually, you’ll develop your own style

  As you prepare always remember that you can’t hit a home run every time you’re up at the plate. All good negotiators know that, and all good negotiators know that a lot of singles—small wins—can add up to a big win over time. So if your negotiating position isn’t rock solid, you might still be able to achieve a lot of smaller successes, many of the musts and wants on your list, without getting everything. That’s how the game works

# KNOW YOUR COUNTERPARTY

- Experienced public speakers will emphatically tell you one of the most important elements of the preparation process is knowing and understanding the audience. Why? It’s simple. If you know the audience, you can know better what they are looking for, what they need from your pitch, and what questions they’re likely to ask. Your counterparty, like you, will enter the negotiation with his own list of goals, musts, and wants. If you know him, you’ll be better prepared to address those musts and wants 

- `knowing them professionally and personally` -- There are two dimensions (usually) to knowing a counterparty. First, you should try to know them as an organization—what is their business, what do they offer, what are their strengths and weaknesses, what makes them successful, or not. Second, you should get to know the people within the counterparty—who are they, what role do they serve in their organization, what sort of negotiating style do they use.

- `researching the organisation` -- You can do research on the organization in many ways:
  -  Online research. A quick tour through the organization’s website will give you a good idea of their products and how they position them—price, quality, service—and how they do business with their customers.
  - Talk to customers. If you have the same customers, or you have “peer” customers in your own business, don’t hesitate to ask them for more info and the “scoop.” If you run a corner deli and are negotiating with a food-service supplier, ask another restaurant-operating peer for his impressions about that supplier
  -  Walk in the door—figuratively or literally. Prior to the negotiation, pay a visit in person to get a feel for how the counterparty operates. If you’re negotiating for a paving project, drop in on one of the others they have in progress. 
  
  Your underlying negotiating strategy should be cut to fit the strategy and style of your negotiating opponent. If you’ve seen your counterparty before as an individual, study her playing style, and learn as much as possible about why she’s investing her time in the negotiation. By reviewing the other party’s training, accomplishments, education, and work history, for example, you can better predict her actions and be more prepared to address them.
  
  Learn as much as you can about the other party’s background. What is this person’s title? Role in the organization? Experience? What kinds of deals does she negotiate? What is her negotiating style?
In today’s split-second information age, it’s possible to find out more about people more quickly than ever before. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, plus the varied ways to network on your own, give you access to information on your counterparty.

  Understand your counterparty’s competition as well—this may even be more important. If you’re selling packaging materials to an electronics supplier, understand not only your competition in the packaging industry but also the competition your counterparty faces in his part of the electronics industry. How do his competitors package their products? Always do your competitive homework beforehand, although some can be done in “real time” during the negotiation if you have Internet access

# KNOW YOUR ALTERNATIVES

- Getting what you want—and getting a negotiation back on track—often requires having alternatives—a Plan B and maybe a Plan C for what you will do if Plan A doesn’t hold water. In this case, Plan B might be a different project design and spec; Plan C might be a different contractor.
Such alternatives, which obviously must be prepared for in advance, do a couple of things: first they set your expectations for what you can get; and second they give you alternative bargaining chips (“Well, you know, Contractor XYZ can do this by June for a thousand dollars less”).
Having one or several alternative courses of action is key to negotiating successfully; indeed it will give you an advantage

- `establishing plan b` -- Whatever you’re negotiating, you should have at least one Plan B that’s as beneficial as your original plan
—else your effort to move the negotiation forward turns into a simple concession and you may not be content with the outcome if Plan A fails. Plan B should be carefully cultivated under the assumption that it’s actually an A Plan. The same amount of research, prodding, and strategizing should occur so that you can spring right back into action if your original plan falls through.

- `using alternatives to your advantage` -- Unquestionably the other party will bring a set of alternatives to the table. It pays to find out what alternatives the counterparty is considering. Discovering what other options your counterparty has lined up allows you to assess his confidence level and leverage in the negotiation. If he doesn’t have any options, or the ones you perceive he does have are weak, then you have the upper hand. You may have the upper hand to drive for some concessions—but again, remember the importance of a win-win and the long-term relationship if you intend to negotiate with this counterparty again. Remember also that you may have no good alternatives next time around.
