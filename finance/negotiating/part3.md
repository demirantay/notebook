# THE METTING ITSELF

- Business negotiation meetings used to all occur in a physical location like a conference room or meeting room, somewhere in an office or hotel, or some other defined venue. Today, business negotiations, and most personal negotiations, can happen almost anywhere, anytime—often over email or by phone. Most of the more important negotiations are planned, but many can occur spontaneously, on the go, and in segments (a couple of phone calls and a meeting, for instance). 

  With planned negotiations, there is an opportunity for some strategy and control of the meeting, including the place, time, and agenda. With unplanned or spontaneous negotiations, you can still control the meeting to a degree (if you want to) by simply stating that you can’t negotiate now—why not do it later at a time and place of mutual agreement?
  
- `managing the agenda` -- Preparing an agenda for the meeting is one way to control the pace and timing of the meeting, and doing so will help you stay focused and (hopefully!) keep everyone on track as well

- `know the venue` -- You should prepare in advance to make sure you understand how all the audio-visual equipment works and decide in advance how meeting notes and decisions will be captured. Will you have a note taker? Electronic note pad and printer? Large white paper pad on an easel? Decide up front—don’t scramble when your counterparty arrives.

  You get extra credit for helping your counterparties get set up, too. You’ll get credit for being a team player and for coming out ahead in your negotiation on its merits—not because they couldn’t get their laptop to synch with your projector.

# NEGOTIATIONG STYLES AND PERSONALITIES

- As you try to “see the outcome,” you should recognize that one of the key variables is the negotiating style of the counterparty—particularly the main spokesperson of the counterparty. The interpersonal dynamic between you and the members of your team—and the leader and the members of the counterparty team—can have a lot to do with the final outcome. Put simply, oil and water at the negotiating table will not bring the best win-win agreement.

# WHY IS STYLE IMPORTANT

- As you start to internalize the basics of negotiating (why negotiate, what to negotiate for, how to give and take, and how to prepare) you should also keep in mind other important pieces of the puzzle. One of these is people. No matter what the negotiation is about, at the end of the day, you’re negotiating with people. 

  Part of the preparation process involves understanding and recognizing the different negotiating styles, personality styles, and personas you’ll find in the negotiating world. Not only will you encounter these styles, but you’ll most likely adopt one or more of them yourself, depending on the situation, your objectives, and your own personality

# THE INTIMIDATOR

- Intimidators prey on emotions. They employ tactics that may not seem fair to you, because they try to keep you off balance and prevent you from thinking clearly. They want you to feel as if the negotiation is personal—and if something goes wrong it’s your fault. They put you on the defensive and try to separate you from your rational self. They hope your bruised ego will prevent you from looking objectively at the negotiation as it unfolds.
 
  Is this psychological warfare? You bet! Intimidators take advantage of your human side, focusing less on the business aspect of what you’re trying to accomplish and more on the personal side. They hope you’ll do anything—give anything—to seek peace and find balance in the negotiation, even if it means your side has to cede ground
  
- `recognizable characteristics` -- If your counterparty is shouting or pounding a fist or slapping papers down on the table, you’re seeing an intimidator in action. These people are loud, talk fast, make hurried movements, and often resort to profanity to make a point. They interrupt constantly. Again, they’re trying to get you to focus on the antics, to prevent you from thinking clearly, to distract you and cause you to lose your train of thought, especially when they don’t like what they’re hearing or they’re not getting their way. They want you to jump from rational negotiator mode to “people pleaser” mode, to jump from getting what you want to placating their needs. Don’t go there!

  Intimidators push you around and try to frighten or annoy you with threats. They might threaten to call off the entire negotiation or to bring in someone from upper management or to withdraw their business altogether. Quite often these behaviors are bluffs; you should handle them accordingly.
Be aware that not all intimidators are loud and blustery. Some may take the quiet approach, shrewdly manipulating you with a barely recognizable yet penetrating insolence

  Whatever the approach, an intimidator may just patronize your business sense. But when an intimidator also patronizes your person—look out! The best way to defend against intimidators is to avoid stooping to their level. Stay calm, focused, and in control. When the intimidator starts raising his voice, keep yours at an even tone. Displaying no emotion whatsoever and going on about your business shows them that you won’t take the bait
  
  Never shout or use abusive language. That only escalates the conflict and takes you away from the issue at hand. Instead, stay calm, focused, and in control.
  
  Your goal is to force your counterparty to talk about the issues, the real reasons you’re both there. In so doing the intimidator might cool down and realize you aren’t playing his game.
If he tries to intimidate you by threatening to pull out of the negotiation altogether, try to feel out how serious this threat is. Offer a few noncritical concessions—or ask point blank what he plans to do if he pulls out. The goal is to call his bluff. If he leaves the table as an intimidation tactic, remember that he’ll probably be back if your negotiating position is solid to begin with—and he’ll be weaker as a result of the called bluff. 

<br>
<br>

# THE FLATTERER

- Like the intimidator, the flatterer focuses more on your emotions than on facts and logic. The difference: the flatterer gets personal by loading the negotiation with positive but insincere remarks. The idea, once again, is to get an emotional response, deflect you from the facts, and throw you off balance.
The flatterer operates under the assumption (mostly correct) that everyone loves to receive compliments, so she lays it on to boost your ego. You may hear glowingly positive comments about your business style, your product, your team, your company, or even your personal appearance. When the car salesperson tells you how good you look driving in a particular car, take the compliment with a grain of salt.
The point of this ego stroking is to appeal to your emotional side, to give you a false sense of reality, even a false sense of security.

- `recognizable characteristics` -- Since the flatterer attempts to render the negotiation more personal than professional, you might see a lot of smiles and compliments right off the bat. Throughout the negotiation, your counterparty might say something like, “I know I can’t pull one over on you, Amanda, that’s why I’m giving it to you straight right now.” The hope is that you’ll be so flattered at the recognition of your expert, seasoned negotiating skills that you’ll bask in the glory, become complacent, and ultimately lose your edge in the negotiation

- `counteraccting the flatterer` -- The first and most obvious step is to recognize flattery and see it for what it is. The flatterer, like the intimidator, is an expert at tapping into your emotions. Such an approach is not only a style but a habit. Your approach should be the same as with the intimidator: Redirect the focus back to the issues at hand.

  Stop and redirect the conversation, even start taking notes, as it shows the counterparty you mean business. Stay calm, ignore the flattery, and don’t let it frustrate you. Redirect by asking open-ended questions that force your counterparty to talk about the details of the negotiation.
  
  Another defensive tactic is to change your tone of voice to one of total indifference. Don’t use inflections or interject any personality into your speech. If you project a steely, emotionless image to the other party and refuse to react to the sweet talk, she will eventually realize that you’re not succumbing to her tactics.
  
  Aside from letting the flattery get you off track, the worst thing you can do is return the flattery. Don’t go there. If you do, she’s roped you into a mutual admiration compact and opened the door for more flattery and even less serious negotiating. Don’t go there.

# THE SEDUCER

- You’ve most definitely experienced this one before—if not in business life, certainly in your personal life. The seducer works his magic through charm. He paints a perfect picture for you and describes everything exactly as you want to hear it. But the devil is in the details—when you start to investigate, the illusion just as magically disappears. The ideal image you had in mind, one that you might have just made a concession for, disappears as you uncover more details.

- `recognizable characterstics` -- The seducer is crafty and sometimes unethical, and he will make attractive offers and concessions to you throughout the negotiating process. Once he has you hooked, he’ll reel you in by telling you what you want to hear—often in half-truths. “You’ll get 10 percent off”—but it isn’t a discount, it’s a credit toward your next purchase

  The seducer may blame “the system” behind him. You’ll hear excuses like, “The paperwork is still being finalized,” “My manager hasn’t authorized it yet,” or “I’m waiting to hear from my attorney.” The deal may be sped up—or slowed down—to meet his objective. He might speed it up to get you out of the store before you notice; or he might slow it down by distracting you with some other detail, a phone call or contingency so once again, you don’t notice the change in the promise. When the counterparty seems to be deliberately speeding up or slowing down, look out.
  
- `counteracting the seducer` -- Make the seducing point seem unimportant. Do not give a single fuck to the seduction part of the negotating. Always stay on the agendas point. If you recognize these elements very ealy one leave the negotiating and seek other alternatives. The seducers usually always try to fuck over the other side of the table. If you decide to continue negotiating with the seducer, be sure to be informed of every detail of the agreements made. Ask lots of questions. Know what you’re getting and how you’re getting it. Facts neutralize the seducer, Finally, be skeptical.

# THE COMPLAINER

- Although the complainer is not as deceitful and unfair as other negotiating personalities covered thus far, she can still undermine the negotiation. The complainer is typically an insecure negotiator—or a master at the ploy—who really wants to be heard and understood

- `recognizable characteristics` -- Complainers succeed when they make you feel bad about what you’re asking for or what you need or want out of a negotiation. They induce guilt, motivating you to moderate your requests in order to keep them happy.
Complainers can sometimes come across as positional negotiators, not win-win negotiators (see Chapter 2). This is because they don’t appear to look past their own needs. 

  You may hear statements like, “How can you expect me to give you a free warranty when you’re already asking me for a discount?” or “You have no idea how expensive it is for production to make the kinds of changes you’re asking for,” or “I’ll get fired if I offer you that deal.” If you listen closely, there’s a cry for help couched in those sentences.
  
- `counteracting the complainer` -- You’ll need a good ear and an empathetic heart to guard against the complainer. If you handle the situation with the right amount of patience and understanding, you’ll get through the fluff and the apparent dug-in position. You can then help her realize that a win-win may well be in sight, which can in turn allay the fears and complaints. She wants your understanding, and perhaps you can give her some without giving away the store.

  Once you’ve finished listening to the complainer’s viewpoint, ask more questions to slowly get back to the details of the negotiation. You might even offer a concession, a small one you saved for later, or one that you can afford to be flexible with. Show complainers that you see their point and will make an effort to make the negotiation successful for both them and you—a win-win.

<br>

# The ARGUER

- No doubt you have certainly experienced this negotiator style in your personal life if not your business life. The arguer is a counterparty who seems to love the conflict, thriving on disagreement—and where there isn’t a conflict or disagreement, he creates one just because that’s where his comfort zone lies! What you’ll see is a constant argument with the main points of a discussion—and/or more subtly, a steady and unrelenting nitpick of the smaller ones. Some arguers may start out calm and accommodating and then switch to an argumentative mode midstream in the negotiation.

- `recognizable characteristics` -- The arguer can be easily spotted by his steady and unprompted debates of your issues and requests. True, a negotiation can be a back-and-forth debate to get to an alternative everyone can agree on. But it turns into an argument when it gets loud and/or nitpicky and when one side or the other presses for the win. Arguers debate and nitpick more than necessary;

- `counteracting the arguer` -- The arguer may pounce on your every move toward progress, hoping to stall the negotiation and buy more time for his case, or to prove his ability to win something. Use the agenda created before the meeting to remind him that you’re on a schedule and would like to stick to it to cover everything. Ignore aimless arguments by reacting to only the important ones.

  Just keep asking yourself: Do I want to be right, or do I want to win? Often you can do both. But in many situations, being right at the expense of winning ultimately means winning the battle but losing the war.
  
  As with other strong styles of negotiation, stick to your facts, ignore appeals to your emotions, and call time-outs where you think it might help. If it really gets bad, advise the counterparty that “things aren’t working” and that you may be forced to leave the negotiation.
Above all, avoid becoming an arguer yourself; that will only feed the fire.

<br>

# THE BSer

- Lies, lies, lies. Little white lies. Half-truths. Stretched truths. Exaggerations. Broken promises. All held to be harmless because—well—this is business, right?
It’s interesting how the process of selling something (or marketing something or advertising something) seemingly empowers us all (most of us anyway) to embellish the truth—even just a little bit. We want to make our product, our service, our company sound better than the competition

  A BSer in a negotiation stretches the truth (or in the worst cases, ignores it altogether) to get what she wants. You may see this through your personal “lie detector.” You may notice shifty eyes, broken voice (or extra firm voice) and feel that something just isn’t righ
  
- `recognizable characteristics` -- When something seems too good to be true, it usually is. Statements unsupported by facts or supported more by pomp and ebullience than facts are dead giveaways. Large quantities of superlatives can also tip you off—most, best, least, cheapest. Loss of eye contact, a change in a speech pattern, and general nervousness can all indicate a lie or exaggeration.

- `coutneracting the BSer` -- The best way to counteract the BSer is to call her out by asking her to support her statements. Don’t be bashful about this—simply state that getting the facts is important for you to have proper confidence in the negotiation. If you call out the facts repeatedly, you’ll make it clear that you’re onto her style and ploy— particularly if you find she’s repeatedly gotten the facts wrong.
  
  The BSer tries to take control of the meeting and get the upper hand by fabricating ideas for you to swallow. If you swallow too many untruths and exaggerations, you open the door to more and more of them. It happens all the time in the business and personal world.
  
  Simple advice: Let your counterparty know early on that you’re onto any lies, you will seek the truth even if it’s uncomfortable, and that if she continues to bend the truth, you’ll depart from the negotiation

# THE LOGICAL THINKER

- Logical thinkers, naturally, can be quite reasonable to work with. However, in some cases they tend to overanalyze issues and linger on them too long The main problem with logical thinkers is that through this constant questioning of details they create a lot of what should be “parking lot” discussions that sidetrack the negotiation. (I call these “parking lot” discussions because they’re the kind that should happen in the parking lot when you’re all done with the main discussion and are getting ready to get in your car and leave.) 

  That said, all but the most detail-adverse negotiators typically like to work with logical thinkers The logical thinker deals in facts and figures. Most are naturally skeptical, and most ask a lot of questions. They emphasize detail. 
  
- `counteracting the logical thinker` -- The best way to deal with the logical thinker is to make every statement clear and back each up by sound research. Don’t use jargon or statistics and facts you can’t support. Be mindful that every person who asks a question isn’t employing the logical thinker style of negotiating—you’ll figure it out by the persistence of questions, the level of detail, and how the questioner responds to the answers. If he appears to be analyzing the facts and your answers to his questions, he fits the logical thinker mold.
Basically you want to try to play his game

  But at the same time, it’s a good idea to assume leadership of the meeting, politely keep it on track and out of the weeds, and keep the agenda and the ultimate win-win deal front and center.

# NEGOTIATING PERSONALITIES

- Negotiating styles are chosen and developed by the individuals who deploy them, while negotiating personalities are innate; they are a natural and typically unchangeable part of someone’s being. Just as you can recognize a negotiating style and deal with it over the table, you can also learn to recognize personalities. 

- `Aggressive/dominating` -- You’ve no doubt dealt with an aggressive personality. This personality is motivated by power and influence,

  __how they operate__ Individuals with aggressive/dominating “driver” personalities tend to talk fast and act fast. They don’t want to spend any more time with you than necessary. They’re usually busy; they thrive in a fast-paced work environment. Preparing to negotiate with them means that you need to have all the facts in order beforehand, and be ready for a speedy discussion. 
  
  __playing defense__ “Fight fire with fire” may be one defensive tactic. Or you can try to slow them down by being cool, calm, and matter-of-fac
  
- `passive/submissive` -- This personality is the exact opposite of the aggressive/dominating personality.

  __how they operate__ Passive/submissive negotiators are typically more focused on pleasing other people than on the mechanics of the negotiation itself. They are often taken advantage of; but watch out. It’s easy to misinterpret these attributes—an aggressive wolf can reside in sheep’s clothing! They are well suited to win-win negotiations, but they may be inclined to give up too much too early.
  
  __playing defense__ No defense is required, save for the passive-aggressive variant noted in the sidebar. When you see passive-aggressive behavior, switch into aggressive defense mode—stick to agendas, facts, and the common purpose of the negotiation. Don’t give in to this behavior.
You may have to work to draw out the true needs or agenda of a passive/submissive negotiator. Work hard to preserve the relationship so that you may get invited back for subsequent negotiations. Although you may be tempted to take advantage of a passive/submissive counterparty, resist doing so—a win-win preserves the relationship and future negotiating opportunities.

- `Logical Analytical` -- __how they operate__ Analyzers like to solve problems and seek deeper understanding of what they already know. They are achievers and have a strong sense of accomplishment—that is more important to them than power in the negotiation. In fact, they seek to achieve power through knowledge and achievement, not through exhibitions of personality or hierarchy and credentials.
Expect logical/analytical personalities to walk into the meeting room armed with data and facts You should prepare by knowing the facts and by being ready to research them on the fly if necessary.

  __playing defense__ It’s simple—be prepared. When possible, have documentation to back up your materials. Never bluff.
  
- `evasive/uncooperative` -- Some negotiators will seem reluctant to negotiate or even to be there at all. 

  __how they operate__ personally insecure or may not feel prepared or knowledgeable about the topic being negotiated. Lack of cooperation and silence for them are survival techniques to avoid saying anything that might be uncomfortable or weaken their position.
  
  __playing defense__ This personality type is difficult; you must diagnose the cause. If the driver is insecurity, try to draw the negotiator out of his shell by reaching out to him and by helping him overcome his fear. Don’t withdraw or withhold information yourself; that just keeps the cycle going and may postpone forever the arrival at a successful outcome.
  
- `expressive/communicative` -- Expressive/communicative negotiators are generally very animated and convey a fun-loving attitude in most situations. They enjoy their work, crave attention, and thrive on rapport

  __how they operate__ Aside from becoming your new best friend, the expressive/communicative negotiators seek to get the most out of the deal by using their social skills and optimism. As such, they may take it personally when you disagree or reject one of their offers. 
  
  Instead of conducting business in an even, businesslike tone, expressive/communicative negotiators turn the negotiation into a social function.
  
  __playing defense__ The best way to work with expressive/communicative negotiators is to allow them to do their thing, at least in the beginning. This helps you build rapport. Then, try to keep the negotiation on task with well- timed questions and a focus on the agenda. Don’t let them jump around, and don’t let them do too much schmoozing. Avoid being too consumed by their charm.
