# Pure Theater: Negotiating on Stage

- In this chapter we explore the pure “theater” of action, the verbal and visual tactics a negotiator might deploy. A counterparty might intentionally use theatrics to throw you a little off balance and gain an edge, or subconsciously use them to the same effect. As is always the case, you can do more than just recognize and defend against these tactics; 

  I’ll cover several verbal and visual negotiation tactics in this chapter so that you can recognize them for what they are: theatrics

# PLAYING DUMB

- You, or your counterparty, may choose to “play dumb”—that is, appear to be less informed or prepared than you are—to appeal to the ego of a counterparty or to find out more information. Instead of risking an uncomfortable confrontation by coming right out with “Why did your production department fail to meet its yearly quota?” you might play dumb instead and ask for this year’s numbers and compare them to last year’s.

  If you start to sense a lot of “beating around the bush” questions, your counterparty might be playing dumb, waiting for you to make a mistake. The best approach is to call him out: Ask right away if there’s a deeper issue he would like to talk about, and try to determine where his questions are going. It may simply be that he needs the information and doesn’t have it on hand.

# WHEN THEY TALK TOO MUCH

- A well-balanced discussion involves an equal amount of talking and listening among all parties. All negotiators want to feel that what they’re saying is important to the rest of the table. When given the chance, however, some people tend to dominate the conversation or discussion by talking too much. Sometimes this is intentional; sometimes the person doesn’t realize how much he’s talking

- `reasons for rambling` -- Rambling can be part of a negotiating style, and the more you read the signals the better you can guess the intentions. A ramble can be either deliberate or purely accidental. Here is a quick field guide.
Deliberate rambling signs include:
  - Denies the opportunity for someone else to interject with comments or questions, even when you signal that you have something to add.
  - Shrugs off your comments and questions, or says, “Let’s talk about that later.”
  - Interrupts when it’s your turn to speak.
  - Repeats thoughts, speaks quickly, and uses a lot of run-on sentences, a possible sign of nervousness and insecurity.
  - Makes a lot of jokes and aimless chitchat; although it may seem this person is avoiding the issues, these could be an attempt to make a good impression or to establish rapport. He seems to crave attention.
  - Fills silences by talking about more concerns or goals; this person may be uncomfortable with long periods of silence or could be thinking out loud.

# A SHOUTING MATCH

- There are different reasons for shouting. We shout out of fear (“What will the boss think if I don’t bring back this deal?”), out of aggression (“I’m telling you loud and clear why this is important!”), or as an attempt to manipulate, keeping the counterparty off balance and insecure about how the negotiation is proceeding

  Generally—as with most other acts of theater—the best countermeasure is to maintain your composure and proceed with professional aplomb. 
  
  Whether the behavior is brought on by stress or is just an act should become clear fairly quickly. Ask for explanations in a diplomatic, calming way; try not to be defensive. If the shouting has arisen from stress (for instance, from a tight deadline), try to help the counterparty work out the causes for the stress (perhaps, by discussing the deadline). Show empathy and remind your counterparty that you seek a win- win.
  
- `other emational outbursts` -- The best way to deal with such theatrics is to, first, ignore them, and second, to try to get behind them to understand their true meaning. You can take breaks. If the outbursts are severe you can offer to postpone or reschedule the negotiation. Try to get the message across that you aren’t likely to respond or give in to theatrical performances

- `if it becomes blatant abuse` -- Abuse comes in many forms. The abuser strives to wreak havoc on your ego to achieve her own goals. Abusers use personal attacks to gain control. Verbal abuse—in the form of name-calling, foul language, emotional exploitation, manipulation, and cruelty—is intended to shake your self-confidence and well- being.
If you’re feeling abused, stick up for yourself. Stop the negotiation and inform the counterparty that the abusive behavior is unacceptable. If you don’t defend yourself, you will lose the respect of the counterparty and the tirade will continue.

# THE UNSPOKEN WORD

- is that 55 percent of what is actually communicated comes from body language, 38 percent is from tone of voice, and 7 percent is from what is actually said.
These numbers are a powerful reminder that you should observe and read gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, body posture, and the use of space in assessing what your counterparty is trying to say or even what he is feeling at the moment.

  Becoming fluent in body language requires time, effort, practice, and application, but it’s worth the effort. Body language skills will help you uncover hidden agendas, discover a person’s true feelings, gain insight into someone’s character, predict reactions, and become aware of your own nonverbal behavior.
  
  It’s useful to observe how body language is used in conjunction with speech. After you gain some experience with this, you’ll realize that nonverbal cues can either emphasize the spoken words or undermine them. For example, if a person says he’s satisfied with your offer but grips his pen and clenches his fist as he says so, you might ask yourself if he’s really unhappy with the offer. 
  
  There are more nonverbal cues than I can list, and there are multiple ways to interpret them. The following table gives a useful sample of some of the more common nonverbal cues.
   - Clenched hands, strong grip on object - Frustration
   - Cocked head - Interested, attentive
   - Covering mouth with hands - Dishonesty, stretching the truth
   - Crossed arms - Defensive, immovable, opposing
   - Crossed legs, ankles - Competitive, opposing
   - Fidgeting - Apprehensive, unconfident
   - Finger tapping or drumming - Boredom or apprehension
   - Frequent nodding - Eagerness
   - Hand-steepling (forming church) - Confidence
   - Hands on cheek, chin, or glasses - Thinking, examining
   - Hands on hips - Confidence, impatience 
   - Hands on table or desk - Poise
   - Head in hand - Disinterested, disrespectful, or disagreeing
   - Leaning forward - Enthusiastic
   - Open arms, hands - Open-minded, approachable
   - Rubbing nose, forehead - Uptight, confrontational
   - Side glance - Suspicion or uncertainty
   - Sitting on edge of seat - Prepared, enthusiastic
   - Slouching, leaning back - Challenging, rejecting
   - Throat-clearing - Nervousness or impatience
   
  But keep in mind that not all human beings do everything the same way, and what might tip the hand of one individual may not necessarily reveal the inner feelings of another.
  
> Speak softly, and carry a big stick-- Loud tones can be used to get someone’s attention or to make a point, but they may sound threatening and filled with anger and thus detract from the point. Soft, quiet tones make people feel relaxed and safe, and as a result they’re more likely to listen to the point. Quiet confidence supported by solid facts (“big stick”) rules and invites the win-win. But not too quiet—you might signal weakness and be ignored!
