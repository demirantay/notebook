# Who’s Who in Accounting

- The world of accounting is populated with lots of players, but the stereotypical number crunchers no longer exist. Math “nerds” hunched over adding machines spewing yard-long tapes full of numbers are yesterday’s accountants. Today, computers do all of that number crunching, leaving accountants free to get creative. You’ll find accountants analyzing data, creating financial forecasts, sniffing out fraud, and even determining Academy Award winners.

  The categories for accounting are broad, such as management accounting, as well as specialized categories, such as forensic accounting and internal auditing. Each of those different types fits somewhere into the three main categories: public, private, and government. In addition, there are different levels in accounting

# CPAS ARE LICENSED

- With the rise of publicly held corporations, more intricate economic dealings, and complicated tax laws, accountants find themselves in great demand. Because so many people depend financially on public corporations—for their livelihoods and their retirement accounts—there’s a lot of work for public accountants to do.

  Certified public accountants (CPAs) provide the highest level of services to the public, due in part to their additional education, experience, and testing requirements. CPAs jump through a lot of hoops to earn and maintain state certification, 
  
- `CPAs by the numbers` -- The journey to becoming a CPA starts in college. At a minimum, prospective CPA candidates must complete at least 150 hours of education, including a bachelor’s degree

  In addition, most states have specific breakdowns of the credits that must be earned. For example, Kansas asks for 30 semester hours in accounting along with 42 semester hours in business and general education courses.
  
  And even after the education requirements are met, and the exam has been passed (followed by intense celebration), that’s still not enough to score a CPA license. Every state has minimum experience requirements, meaning candidates actually have to work in accounting (usually for at least two years) before they can earn that certification.
  
- `The CPA exam` -- The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, AICPA (discussed in detail in the following section), creates this days-long, multipart, computer-based test to make sure only the most qualified candidates earn the coveted CPA designation.

  These four exam sections are:
  - 1. Auditing and Attestation, which covers topics like ethics, professional responsibility, risk assessment, and reporting on the reliability of financial statements
  - 2. Financial Accounting and Reporting, which includes financial reporting, financial statement accounts, and specific select transactions
  - 3. Regulation, which asks questions about federal tax procedures, business law, and federal taxation of individuals and entities
  - 4. Business Environment and Concepts, which delves into corporate governance, economic concepts, financial management, and information systems
  
- `YEARLY CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION` -- One of the primary ways CPAs stay on top of the always-evolving tax laws, compliance regulations, and technical innovations is through continuing professional education. Though state law governs the specific requirements, all CPAs must complete at least some course work every year, covering topics relevant to their practices.

  Every time a CPA renews her license, she has to attest that her required CPE hours are complete. Because ethics is such a big part of the profession, CPE reporting generally follows the honor system.

# THE AICPA

- The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) sets the standards for professional training, conduct, and ethics for the CPA profession, and it’s done so for more than 100 years. With nearly 420,000 members from 143 countries around the world, the U.S.-based association has become a global force in the accounting industry.

  In addition to strict professional guidelines, the AICPA sets auditing standards for a variety of U.S. entities, including:
  - Private companies
  - • All levels of government
  - • Nonprofit organizations

  One of the AICPA’s most important roles, though, is tracking and enforcing compliance with ethical and professional standards.
  
- `need an accountant` -- One public service the AICPA provides is helping people and companies find the right kind of accounting professional. Whether you need a licensed Personal Financial Specialist (PFS), a CPA with business valuation credentials, or one of the other seasoned professionals accredited by the AICPA, the organization’s website (www.aicpa.org) can get you started.

- `setting a very high bar` -- The AICPA sets very high standards for its members (and for all accounting and accounting-related professionals, really), particularly when it comes to ethics. They have a very strict code of conduct governing those ethics, as well as professional responsibilities.

  Independence: is one of the primary guiding principles for CPAs in public practice. Here, independence means that the CPA has no financial, personal, professional, or other connection to the company for which he’s providing audit-type services including reviews, which offer limited assurance that there are no material misstatements in financial statements, a lower level of confidence than audits. This complete separation is crucial for a CPA’s credibility
  
  Integrity and Duty of Care: In addition, CPAs are expected to always act with integrity, honesty, and objectivity. They carry the responsibility of acting in the public interest at all times, and the public must be 
  
  For CPAs who want to dive deeper into a specific practice area, the AICPA offers specialized credentials for a variety of professional niches, including:
  - • Personal financial planning
  - • Business valuation
  - • Forensic accounting
  - • Information and technology
  - • Management accounting
  
- `raising your finanical iq` -- A big part of the AICPA’s mission involves the general public: helping people better understand and manage their personal finances. To that end, the association takes part in a lot of community outreach efforts, and offers tools and programs to anyone who wants to learn more about money, budgeting, financial planning, and taxes.

  Feed the pig: The group also promotes the Feed the Pig program (www.feedthepig.org). This program encourages young working adults to start saving money, pay down debt, and grow their wealth.
  
  360 days of financial literacy: Another AICPA free public service is the 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy project (www.360financialliteracy.org), a whole-life Internet-based program that begins with inspiring kids to pick up good financial habits, and follows through with advice for people in every stage of life. The site offers targeted help for students, small business owners, parents, military families, and more, because every financial situation is different.
  
  Total tax insights: The AICPA’s Total Tax Insights calculator, another free tool, is designed to help Americans get a better picture of all of the taxes they pay, including income and property taxes.

# BOOKKEEPING VERSUS ACCOUNTING

- Bookkeeping and accounting are related in the same way that recipes are related to ingredients. Ingredients are the raw materials you need to create a meal, and bookkeeping provides the raw materials you need to develop useful financial reports.

- `accounting needs bookeping` -- You cannot have accounting without bookkeeping; bookkeeping is a crucial part of the whole process. You can, however, have bookkeeping without accounting. 

  In theory, there’s a wide gap between bookkeepers and accountants, but in reality the lines are often blurry. By definition, a bookkeeper compiles and records information. An accountant takes that information to the next level by analyzing that information, and then presenting it in a more useful 
  
  format (such as specialized reports), explaining what all the numbers mean, and making recommendations for future action.
  
- `HE INS AND OUTS OF BOOKKEEPING` -- Bookkeeping is really just what it sounds like: keeping the books. That includes every facet of recordkeeping. A basic example would be writing a check, recording it, marking it off when it has been cashed, and making sure it was cashed for the right amount.

  Bookkeeping used to be the most labor-intensive and time-consuming part of accounting. But then computers came along and took over these bookkeeping tasks. Even so, bookkeeping is still one of the most important parts of accounting, because without it there would be no way to keep track of your business finances
  
  Yes, bookkeeping takes time, and you probably do not have tons of time to spare, but you can get around that by using easily navigated business bookkeeping software or apps, or by hiring a part-time bookkeeper. At least in the very beginning when your business is first starting up, though, it’s good to do some of it on your own. This work allows you to get a good feel for how your business finances work and develop a better understanding of how everything fits together financially.
  
- `they are not all accountats` -- A  lot of people work under the accounting umbrella, but they are not all accountants—even though people think of them that way. Included in this general industry are professionals such as bookkeepers, tax preparers, auditors, and even financial planners. And while all of these professionals use accounting information to do their jobs, they don’t have to be accountants.

- `accounting ties all of it together` -- Now that you know what bookkeeping is, it’s time to turn our attention to accounting. Accounting covers a lot of ground and includes everything from the framework that supports all of the bookkeeping tasks to the final analysis of what all the numbers mean and what to do with them and most important, communicates all of this in a useful way to the people who need to know it.

# ENTERTAINMENT ACCOUNTANTS

- Working in the entertainment industry requires a specific skill set, as the accounting tasks performed here don’t really make sense in other types of businesses. For example, some entertainment accountants need to know the ins and outs of production accounting, whether they’re working for a movie producer, a television network, or a Web-based series. Some entertainment accountants work on contracts, requiring familiarity with profit participation, syndication, and royalty rules. Others work directly for the stars, overseeing every aspect of their personal finances, from contract negotiations to estate planning to managing cash flow. And a very special few get to work on the biggest showbiz event of all—the Oscars.

- `accountant to the stars` -- Along with personal trainers, personal assistants, and personal chefs, many show biz professionals also keep personal accountants on the payroll. From actors to script writers to musicians, all of these artists have special accounting needs that are unique to their industry.

  These accountants get involved in every area that touches finances, like international currency exchange computations, managing the celebrity’s cash flow, and complex contract negotiations. Those contracts might include things like royalty payments and residuals, which can be paid out over many years and so require constant tracking. For musicians and authors who go on tours, the accountant prepares travel budgets and manages the travel expenses.
  
- `What Are Residuals?` -- Residuals, in the entertainment industry, are payments made to performers for showings of their work after the original debut. They’re most commonly talked 

  about in the context of TV reruns, where an actor may get paid for a specified number of years (or forever) every time their show appears on TV.

  Since these creative productions require a ton of planning at the beginning and a lot of wrap-up work at the end, production accountants are often the first ones working on the project and the last ones to finish up. 
  
  Each job that a production accountant takes on starts with securing financing and setting the budget for the project, with input from the producers or the studio. This boring-sounding budgeting task takes on a tinge of glamour when you add entertainment into the picture. How many big
  
  name stars can the production afford? How many of the production crew will need to travel to Thailand for location shoots?
  
  Once the initial budget is set, some traditional financial tracking comes in. Like other businesses, creative productions have standard expenses such as payroll, utilities, and office supplies that are mixed in with more unusual items such as period costumes, wigs and hairpieces, Lamborghinis, explosives, and set design props, among others.

# FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS

- Financial fraud happens more often than you might expect. Armed with analytical minds, financial insights, and keen eyes for dodgy details, forensic accountants swoop in to uncover the fraud and take down the perpetrators. Corporate fraud, embezzlement schemes, and identity theft cases occur with alarming frequency,

  Even with all of those protections in place, financial fraud occurs daily, keeping forensic accountants in constant demand.
  
- `license to probe` -- The AICPA offers a specialized certification for CPAs skilled in fraud detection. With special education, training, and experience,

  Among the crimes that these financial detectives solve are:
  
  - • Fraudulent insurance claims
  - • Embezzlement
  - • Telemarketing swindles
  - • Bankruptcy fraud
  - • Misappropriated assets
  - • Financial statement scams
  
  The report also highlights the most common type of fraud (asset misappropriation, where insiders steal from the company, like embezzlement), and the least common type (financial statement fraud, where corporations report purposely misleading information on their statements).
  
- `joining the G-man` -- Back in 1908 the FBI was first formed, and that first rush of agents (sometimes called G-men) included a lot of accountants. In fact, accountants comprised more than a third of those original agents, and they truly pulled their weight. It was the accountants who brought down famed mobster Al Capone, arresting him for tax evasion even as he neatly dodged other criminal charges. 

  It’s not easy to join the G-men as a forensic accountant. To even apply, hopeful accountants must have completed either a bachelor’s degree with at least 24 semester hours of accounting or a master’s degree in accounting. On top of that, the agency prefers applicants to have at least one professional designation, including CPA, CFE (Certified Fraud Examiner), CIA (Certified Internal Auditor).
  
- `divorce accountats` -- Forensic accountants don’t track only criminals. These days, their uniquely honed skills are often used to dig up hidden funds in divorce cases. Sadly, these niche professionals are in demand, and that demand is rising.

  Too often, one spouse will try to hide or understate their earnings, their ability to earn, or their personal assets (like retirement benefits or separately owned properties) in an effort to minimize alimony or child support, or to skew the division of property.
  
  To do this job well, the accountant has to be comfortable with handholding, as the people who hire “divorce accountants” are often in raw emotional states.
  
  These professionals don’t come cheap, often charging between $200 and $300 per hour for complex divorce cases
