# THE ACCOUNTING CYCLE

- Traditionally, an accounting cycle refers to the processes and procedures performed to record a company’s transactions. The cycle starts with a transaction, moves through the creation of financial statements, and ends with a closeou Though a lot of the steps are now invisible thanks to accounting software, it’s important to know what the steps are and what actually happens even if software is doing all the work. The complete traditional accounting cycle can be summed up in eight basic steps. Accountants:
  - 1. Record transactions in the daily journals
  - 2. Post journal entries to the appropriate ledgers
  - 3. Prepare a trial balance of all general ledger accounts
  - 4. Create a working trial balance, complete with adjusting entries
  - 5. Enter those adjusting entries into the general journal, and then post them to the general ledger
  - 6. Prepare a set of financial statements
  - 7. Close out the temporary accounts
  - 8. Create a post-closing trial balance
  
- `taking the steps` -- You probably record transactions, which is the first step in the accounting cycle, every day. When you break it down, this step involves recognizing what counts as a transaction, identifying all the details pertinent to that transaction, and then recording those details in a journal. A journal is a sort of transaction diary

   This is step two. So if a journal entry included the cash account, eventually that part of the transaction would be posted to the cash account’s ledger page With accounting software, this happens automatically
   
 - `divisible by 9` -- Step three, the trial balance is a way to make sure everything has been posted correctly, it’s basically a test to see if the accounts balance. To create this report, you list all the accounts in the ledger along with their ending debit or credit balances; then you add up all the debits and all the credits. If the total debits equal the total credits, the accounts balance; if not, there’s a mistake somewhere.
  
  Step four—working trial balance—brings adjustments into play. Sometimes, those adjustments simply correct errors. Other times, they account for things that haven’t been recorded yet because of timing. For example, if the accounting period ends on a Tuesday, but your company pays its employees on Friday, you’d have to adjust the payroll expenses to capture two days’ worth of employee pay
  
  Step five simply formalizes the adjusting entries made in the working trial balance. In this fifth step those entries get recorded in the journal, and then are posted to each relevant account in the ledger
  
  Step six is one of the most important for business owners: creating a set of financial statements The three primary financial statements are:
    - 1. The balance sheet
    - 2. The statement of profit and loss
    - 3. The statement of cash flows
    
  Together, these financial statements sum up all of the activity for the period, and offer a detailed picture of the company’s current state
  
- `journals and ledgers` -- • Journals were used to record transactions as they happened. • Ledgers were used to carry the balance of each account.

- `A TRIAL BALANCE TALE` -- Though it may seem obsolete, thanks to accounting software, the trial balance provides a valuable business tool. Yes, everything should automatically be in balance—because software won’t let you enter unbalanced 

  transactions—but just because a transaction is balanced, it doesn't necessarily mean it’s correct. For example, a $50.00 sale could be accidentally entered as $5,000; the entry would be balanced, but wrong. A quick look at the trial balance might let you see that something is o
  
- `a matter of timing` -- An accounting cycle marks the beginning and end of an accounting period, but the length of that period is up to you, based on what makes sense for your business. The most commonly used timeframes are months, quarters (three-month periods), and years. Publicly traded companies are legally required to file reports at specific times, so their cycles typically follow those rules. An accounting period is also known as a fiscal period

# ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATION

- Organization is the secret key to accounting—imagine what things would look like if the numbers just floated around haphazardly. You’d never know which customers owed you money, for example, or why you were writing checks. Systematically sorting revenues and expenses, customers and vendors, lets you focus your energy on growing and tending your business  If your records are chaotic, your company’s chance of success plummets

- `there is still a lot of papaer` -- By now you have probably noticed that accounting involves dozens of forms, hundreds of other pieces of paper, and thousands upon thousands of numbers. Keeping track of all that information can be tricky, though accounting software makes it a lot easier. Having a system in place that tells you how and when to fill out every form, what information you need from each piece of paper, and where all of those numbers go makes the whole thing manageable.

- `Physical Organization` -- You should use clearly labeled file folders to keep your accounting data organized. Even if your bookkeeping takes place in the cloud, there’s most likely still a paper trail for many of your transactions, and you need an efficient way to track those papers. Optimally, businesses keep one set of files for their vendors, another for customers, and a third for general expenses. In addition, it’s important to set up a file for each asset and liability that shows up in your books. For example, keeping separate folders for each different vendor, rather than just shoving them all in the same file, helps you more easily track down purchase orders and invoices in the event of a problem or disagreement. Finally, and very important, all businesses should maintain files for paper copies of all tax returns, including sales tax and payroll taxes

- `Accounting Procedures` -- The physical organization of your paper is just one piece of the puzzle, though. You also need to come up with procedures for your accounting tasks. Having a single standard way of doing things will streamline your tasks, and will make it much easier when you turn over the job to someone else. Daily transactions can pile up quickly if you don’t enter them as they occur

  Developing a routine is pretty much the only way to get a handle on this considerable work;
  
- `get your personal ducks in a row` -- Even though organization is very important at tax time, good organization can help your finances stay on track year round. Developing a budget is one of the best ways to get organized and stick to a system. Whether for business or your personal life, you already know that you need records and receipts to do your taxes. It’s especially important to keep track of expenses and deductions in case IRS auditors come calling. The best way to avoid future problems is to carefully organize the paperwork as you get it.

  it’s easier to do that once a month rather than face an enormous pile once a year.
  
- `what to keep what to toss` -- here are some good basic guidelines (including some important IRS rules) to follow
  - • Keep all of your tax records and external tax documents—like W-2s, 1099s, and 1098s—for at least three years after the return was actually filed
  - • Hold on to receipts for deductible expenses of $75 or more
  - • Create a long-term storage system (at least seven years) for crucial documents like employee records, bank statements, contracts, and payroll and payroll tax records
  - • Keep paid medical bills, paid tuition bills, charitable contribution receipts, and business/personal mileage logs for at least five years
  - • Hang on to your income tax returns for at least seven years

# Assets, Liabilities, and Equity

- One of the foundations of accounting is the accounting equation:
  
  assets = liabilities + equity
  
  The three pieces of that equation can define both your business and your personal finances  They tell you what you have, what you owe, and how much of what’s yours you truly own.
  
  On the personal side, these three factors determine your income needs, your credit rating, and your overall wealth. The three pieces are equally crucial for your business, because they are the tools you use to generate revenue.

# THE ACCOUNTING EQUATION

- This equation, assets = liabilities + equity, sits at the very core of accounting, expressing one of the most central accounting basics: everything must remain in balance. Changes in one side of the equation require changes in the other.

  Financing your assets with debt (like taking out a mortgage to buy an office building) acts exactly the same way: assets increase, but so do liabilities. As long as eac individual transaction has equal debits and credits, your books will remain in balance, and the accounting equation will hold true.
  
- `what is your net worth` -- “Net worth” is another name for equity, and what it’s usually called in the realm of personal finances. In the best circumstances, assets (what you have) exceed liabilities (what you owe), for a positive net worth. But if loans and credit card debt get out of control, or your home’s appraisal value drops, a negative net worth could arise.

  Let’s take a look at how the accounting equation covers your personal finances. We’ll use a common example: your house. As a homeowner, you own your house, or at least a big chunk of it; the part you don’t exactly own yet is your outstanding mortgage. In terms of the accounting equation, it looks like this: house = mortgage + equity.

  Say you bought your house for $250,000 with a $15,000 down payment and a $235,000 mortgage. Your accounting equation would look like this:

  As you pay down your mortgage, the numbers shift, but always stay in balance. So after several years pass, your equation might look like this:

  $250,000 (asset) = $223,000 (liability) + $27,000 (equity)
  
  Your home is just one part of your total financial picture. You also probably have some bank accounts, some credit card debt, a house full of furnishings and “stuff,” a car, a car loan, and a retirement fund. All of those pieces fit together like a puzzle to form a perfectly balanced accounting equation.
  
- ` a real business example` -- In business, it’s actually much easier to see the accounting equation in action, because everything is already accounted for and categorized. To get a handle on any company’s accounting equation just look at their balance sheet. 

  For example, Facebook released its annual balance sheet on December 31, 2015. This report indicated that the company had total assets of $49,407,000. Facebook also reported total liabilities of $5,189,000, and total shareholders’ equity of $44,218,000. So, putting it all together, Facebook’s accounting equation on that date was:

# WHAT ARE ASSETS?

- So while you know now that assets are a crucial component of the accounting equation, here we’re going to take a deeper dive into the world of assets, and their accounting impact. Equally (and maybe even more) important, we’ll talk about how specific assets can be used to grow net worth.

  On the business side of things, assets are those things that your company owns, from the computer on your desk to the file cabinet in the backroom to the delivery van in the driveway. It works the same way for your personal assets. The money in your checking account, your clothes, your 60-inch flat screen TV, and the fork you just used at dinner all count as assets. It does not matter whether your assets are big or small. All that matters is that you or your company owns them, and that they have monetary value. For that matter, assets don’t even have to be physical things. Patents and copyrights, for example, count as assets even though you can’t touch them. Also, anything you or your company has a legal right to get, such as a tax refund or a future payment from a customer, is accounted for as an asset.
  
- `every business has assets` -- Your company’s assets appear on its balance sheet, which is one of the main financial statements produced at the end of each accounting period. On this report, the assets will be split into different categories to make analysis easier. The order in which you list them on the balance sheet typically matches the way they appear in your chart of accounts (a formal listing of every account and its corresponding account number), which is usually in the order of liquidity (how quickly they can be turned into cash). Assets do more than just show up on reports, though. They are the resources your company uses to produce revenue, and revenue is what keeps your company alive.

- `personal assets` -- You probably don’t think about this very often, but just like in a business, everything you own is your asset. And while this might not seem very important, sometimes it will be. When you apply for a loan, the lender may ask to see a personal balance sheet—and your assets will be the highlight. If you buy homeowner’s or renter’s insurance (which you absolutely should), the insurance company may ask for a list of your assets. So when the occasion arises, it’s important to know what you have. The big stuff is obvious: house, car, motorcycle, boat, or truck. But other personal items that count as assets may not be as apparent. When you’re taking stock of your assets, make sure to include:
  - • All of the money in savings and checking accounts (right now)
  - Investments
  - • Retirement accounts
  - • Jewelry (including watches)
  - • Furniture 
  - Bicycles
  - ... etc.

# BREAKING DOWN ASSET CATEGORIES

- Since there are so many different kinds of assets, they get split into categories to make the accounting less cumbersome. There are four commonly used groupings, which are pretty standard across businesses:
  - 1. Current assets: Current assets include anything that is expected to be turned into cash or used up within one year, such as inventory or cash itself.
  - 2. Investments: The investments category contains holdings, such as mutual funds or municipal bonds that are not really used in the normal course of business; they’re a way to make some extra income using funds that the company doesn’t need to use for anything else right now.
  - 3. Fixed assets (also called “property, plant, and equipment”): Fixed assets have relatively long lives, and they are regularly used to support regular operations; examples include trucks, desks, and computer systems.
  - 4. Intangible assets: Intangible assets are long-term assets that have no physical form but are still worth money to the company, such as a corporate logo or a trademark.
  
  Basically anything that is expected to be converted to cash within one year of a company’s balance sheet date is considered a current asset; all other assets are plunked down into one of the long-term categories
  
- `liquid gold` -- Liquidity refers to how easy it would be to turn an asset into cash if you absolutely had to. Your checking account counts as cash, making it 100 percent liquid. Inventory normally moves pretty fast, and so it could be considered a quick liquid asset. By contrast, your company’s customized delivery truck might take a long time to sell, and so it would not be considered a liquid asset.

- `current assets turn to cash` -- Current assets include anything that could be or that you expect to be converted into cash within a year of the date on your balance sheet. These assets are listed in their order of liquidity, from cash down to the current asset that you expect would take the longest to convert to cash
  - Cash, which includes every cash account plus any cash you have on hand
  - • Accounts receivable, which is money your customers owe you for sales you made to them
  - • Inventory, which includes anything you will resell regardless of the form it’s in now
  - • Short-term investments, such as stocks or bonds that you plan to cash out within a year

  For small businesses and startups especially, liquidity can mean the difference between success and failure.
  
- `long term invesments` -- When your company is doing well and you have extra cash lying around, you may choose to invest that money so it can earn even more.

  Long-term investments are often used to build asset reserves that can eventually be used to finance expansions, thereby minimizing the amount you would have to obtain from outside sources. Outside capital can be costly: bank loans always come with interest payments, and bringing on investors or business partners dilutes your ownership
  
  As your expansion plans get closer, and you think the time is coming to liquidate those investments, you can shift your long-term investments into your short-term investments. Investments you expect to sell within the upcoming year transform into current assets for the company’s balance sheet.
  
- `fixed assetss` -- Any physical asset that your company owns and does not intend to sell falls into the fixed-asset category. Fixed assets range in size, useful life, and purpose. A $40 office chair counts as a fixed asset just as much as a 15,000-square-foot storage facility

  Fixed assets can include things such as:
  - • Land
  - • Buildings
  - etc.
  
  Fixed assets also come with a special contra account (an account with a normal credit balance that offsets the fixed assets account). This special contra account, called accumulated depreciation, fits in the asset category but has a normal credit balance (which is what makes it a contra account). It holds all of the depreciation expense ever taken on the connected assets. 
  
  Depreciation expense tracks the declining value of assets year by year, and lets you take that decline as a tax-deductible expense spread out over the entire life of the asset
  
  Some companies have assets without physical form that they plan to hold on to for the long haul. These are called intangible assets, and some companies couldn’t succeed without them. In order to count an intangible as an asset, your company must own it or the rights to it, and it has to have a measurable dollar value. Some of the more common intangible assets include patents, copyrights, licensing agreements, trademarks, franchise rights, leaseholds, and goodwill (the most intangible of them all).
  
- Like fixed assets, intangible assets have finite useful lives over which they decline in value, at least for accounting purposes. This decline is known as amortization, and it counts as a tax-deductible expense. Since the longevity of intangible assets can be hard to pin down, their usefu

  lives are considered to be their legal lives or 40 years, whichever is shorter. For example, a design patent issued by the U.S. government lasts for 15 years. Amortization can be held in a separate contra account, called accumulated amortization, or may simply be deducted directly from the intangible asset balance; the choice is yours (or your accountant’s).
