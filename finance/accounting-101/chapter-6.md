# A CLOSER LOOK AT CURRENT ASSETS

- As you now know, in the world of accounting the term “current assets” refers to assets that can be converted to cash within one year. These are the assets that your business would use in its everyday activities, or that you would personally use to maintain your daily finances. For making ends meet, these are hands down the most important assets you have; when you’ve amassed enough in current assets to get by and fund emergencies, then your focus can shift toward long-term assets and growing wealth.

  In terms of personal finance, your current assets will mainly be composed of your instant cash accounts: checking and saving

  Another technicality: investments (like stocks and mutual funds) count as liquid assets because they are generally easy to cash in quickly
  
  For a small or startup business, current assets can make the difference between staying afloat and folding. If a company can’t pay its bills, it won’t be able to stay in business long. That’s why properly managing current assets is the key to early success.
  
- `please pay within 30 days` -- Accounts receivable is often the largest current asset for service businesses, and among the largest for inventory-based businesses. This account describes itself perfectly: It’s the amount of money you expect to receive from customers who made purchases on account.

  Say your company makes custom standing desks for $500 each. A legal firm in town buys 10 desks, on account, for a total purchase of $5,000. Your company delivers the desks, and sends them an invoice. Your invoice would include the price of the desks ($5,000), plus sales tax (at 5 percent: $250), plus your $50 delivery fee. That inclusive invoice total of $5,300 ($5,000 + $250 + $50) would now be included in accounts receivable.
  
  Managing your accounts receivable well can keep you in business; extending too much credit or letting customers slide can crush your company. No matter how much you want to make a sale, it’s important to make sure your customers are going to pay you.
  
  In the meantime, for their first purchase, you can extend limited credit (as much as you could stomach losing) or require a large down payment.
  
- `the trick to getting paid early` -- Don’t underestimate the power of a great deal. One of the best ways to get customers to pay quickly is to offer early bird discounts. For example, you can offer a 2 percent discount to customers that pay you within 10 days. Sure, you’ll get a little less money, but you won’t have to worry about collecting it.

- `collections` -- Collections are on the other side of the deal. It’s an uncomfortable chore, and a lot of small business owners simply avoid it. But if a customer has not paid you despite repeated “overdue” bill notices, you (or one of your trusted employees) will need to get tough. The first step—which will seem obvious, but a lot of companies don’t put in place—is to cut off credit sales to them, and not let them buy anything else on account. If you have multiple offices or several employees, you need to make it clear to everyone that this customer’s credit is frozen. The next step is contacting them in a more direct manner, whether it’s by email to the company’s owner or by making a call to their accounting department. Sometimes

  you’ll end up writing off an account. But more often than not, if you’re persistent, you will get paid
  
- `you have to have stuff to sell stuff` -- Companies that sell products need products to sell, and that means inventory. Whether you’re selling ready-made goods, products that you have to assemble before selling, or products that you make, every component that goes into the items you’re selling counts in inventory.

  Once you have inventory, you also have to track it, and that can be tricky because (if you’re lucky) this asset will move very quickly. Knowing your inventory numbers at all times is crucial to your company’s success.
  
  On the other hand, having too much inventory on hand can drag your business down when it ties up too much of the company’s cash and takes up space for other items that move more quickly
  
- `what to do with extra cash` -- Once your business is off the ground, you may actually find yourself with a cash surplus. But that surplus can dissolve as quickly as it grew, due to product or service obsolescence, economic changes, or changes in your personal situation

   Keeping the cash in the business can cushion your company against setbacks. Cash itself, though, doesn’t work very hard these days, as savings account interest rates currently hover near zero. Many businesses therefore turn to the stock market in the hopes that they’ll rack up some extra profits before they need that money back.

 # THE IMPORTANCE OF CASH

- With a new or small business, cash is absolutely the most important current asset you can have. In fact, it’s the most current asset, as cash is 100 percent liquid. Without it in plentiful supply, your business simply cannot survive. Unfortunately, many business owners confuse profits with cash, thinking that if they’re earning income it means they have money. That’s not always true. Learning how to effectively manage your cash flow, especially in the early, struggle-filled days, can mean the difference between success and failure for your company.

- `flowing in wrong direction` -- Product-based businesses often have money problems, at least starting out. That’s because companies that sell products have to first buy them (or the materials to create them). That almost always means cash has to go out before it can possibly come in. 

  The number one reason why small companies go out of business is because they’re out of cash. In fact, the bankruptcy courts are full of small business owners whose companies just couldn’t pay the bills anymore, even though their businesses were showing profits.
  
  Luckily, there are a lot of things you can do to prevent that dire situation. The most important one is to know how cash really flows in and out of your business. Then you can plan for shortfalls before they occur, nipping that problem in the bud. The easiest way to avoid cash crunches is to put enough money into the business at the start; absent that, you may have to contribute more capital, or take out a loan to cover temporary crises. 
  
- `product based businesses get cash crunched` -- As we discussed, in order to sell products, your company needs to have products available, and that often comes with a substantial cash outlay. New and small companies are especially vulnerable to cash flow issues, and holding products ties up a lot of cash.

  This is one of those times when an experienced small business accountant can be invaluable.
  
- `work with vendors` -- While you want your customers to pay you as quickly as possible, you also want your vendors to give you as much (reasonable) time as you need to pay their invoices. Managing your company’s accounts payable, especially if you have a product-based company, can help the cash flow more smoothly.

  When your business is facing a cash crunch, you can ask vendors for extended payment terms. Most of the time, they’ll work with you; they want to make it easy for you to pay them. As long as you stick to a payment plan, they’re likely to continue extending the credit
  
  If your company cash is in decent shape, and you can pay the bills on time, you can still stretch it to the limit to maximize cash flow. One simple way to do that is with electronic payments; even when you make them at the very last minute you will still be paying on time.
  
  When your business is in a positive cash flow groove you can take advantage of early-payment discount terms. If a vendor offers a percentage off the invoice in exchange for early payment, and your company has enough cash on hand, take the discount. It will not only conserve cash, it also gives your company a good rep in the eyes of the vendor

# A CLOSER LOOK AT FIXED ASSETS

- As we discussed, a fixed asset is anything tangible your company owns that is used (in some way) to create revenues over the long term, with a useful life of at least one year. If you can’t touch it, or it will be used up within a year, it’s not a fixed asset. A fixed asset also can’t be something the company sells in the normal course of business. For example, if your company has a delivery van that it uses to make deliveries, it would count as a fixed asset; but if your company sells delivery vans, those would count as inventory, and not as fixed assets.

- `pp&e` -- Fixed assets include things like:
  - • Land
  - • Buildings
  - • Vehicles
  - • Heavy machinery
  - • Computer systems
  
- `land ho` -- In accounting, property refers to land and buildings. This is property you’re using in the course of business, and includes things like free-standing stores, office buildings, warehouses, factories, manufacturing plants, and the land those are built on. These fixed assets are counted as yours as long as you own them or have what’s known as a capital lease.

- `plant` -- “Plant” applies mainly to companies that make something, as opposed to companies that only sell finished goods. The plant category covers the kind of fixed assets you’d find, for example, in a manufacturing facility or a bakery. In this category, you would include things like:
Manufacturing machinery
  - • Assembly line equipment
  - • Ovens and walk-in freezers
  - • Drill presses and lathes
  - • Textile machinery

  Anything the company uses to create or transform goods fits under the plant umbrella.
  
- `equipement` -- All the fixed assets that don’t fit into the property and plant categories fall under the equipment group. This type of equipment includes things like forklifts, delivery vans, display cases, office furniture, and computer systems.

- `fixed asset guidelines` -- Fixed assets take more work than other assets, from both a real-life maintenance perspective and from the accounting viewpoint

  Since so much can go into fixed assets, there are a lot of guidelines to help you deal with them for accounting purposes. Some of the guidelines come from the IRS, and you may have to use them when you do your business tax return. Others come from GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)
  
- `calculating fixed assets cost` -- For the more basic fixed assets, such as file cabinets, desks, and chairs, the costs are easy to determine. When you start adding in things such as down payments and trade discounts, as you would with a fleet vehicle, for instance, the accounting gets just a little trickier. The basics, though, are the same for every fixed asset you have. The accounting rule here is called the cost principle, which means that you will value your fixed assets based on what you paid for them, never based on their market value (or how much they are “really” worth). That cost, though, includes absolutely everything you had to pay to get that asset ready for work

- `add it in` -- If you have to do something to your property so the asset will work properly, whatever you pay for that goes into your asset cost

- `a word about deprecation` -- Any conversation about fixed assets would be incomplete without a nod to depreciation. Depreciation is an accounting construct designed to capture a virtual decline in value of the asset as it gets used over time. That doesn’t mean the asset necessarily loses actual value—some assets don’t, and some may even become more valuable over time despite ongoing wear and tear. But for accounting and tax purposes, assets get used up, and that is measured in terms of periodic depreciation expense.

  The asset, or rather contra asset, account to hold all of the depreciation attached to fixed assets over time is called accumulated depreciation. Accumulated depreciation is known as a contra account because even though it fits in the asset category, where accounts are supposed to have debit balances, this account carries a credit balance. That credit balance is used to offset the value of the fixed assets.

  Here’s an example: Say your company has a single fixed asset that was originally worth $10,000, and you’ve had it for four years. Your accountant takes $1,000 in depreciation expense every year. So at the end of four years, the accumulated depreciation would be $4,000. Now, the net accounting value of your fixed asset would be $6,000, the original $10,000 cost less the $4,000 accumulated depreciation
