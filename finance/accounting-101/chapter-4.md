# Setting the Framework

- Now that software and apps have taken over so many basic bookkeeping tasks, it may seem useless to learn about tedious-sounding accounting details, like knowing the different types of accounts and how they work with each other. But if you want to see your business succeed, it’s important to understand your books, from setup to annual financial statements, even if you hire an accountant or bookkeeper to run the numbers for you.

  Accounting isn’t only about collecting payments and taking care of bills; it’s also about using numbers to support your vision for the company, and help it grow profitably.

# ACCOUNTING STARTS WITH ACCOUNTS

- As you might expect, a business accounting system is made up of accounts. Here, accounts serve as a way to group information, sort of like a financial filing system. For example, everything that happens with cash, such as writing a check or depositing the day’s cash register take, gets run through a cash account. And the monthly checks to cover rent on the office all show up in both the cash and the rent expenses account.

  Almost any grouping that would be meaningful to the business can become an account. Of course, there are some standard accounts, and some standard account names, such as Cash and Depreciation Expense, that you will find in almost every company’s bookkeeping system. There are also plenty of specialized accounts that are unique to particular businesses and don’t really apply anywhere else. For example, a florist would not need a “ketchup and mustard” account, and a hot dog vendor wouldn’t need a “ribbons and bows” account. All companies, though, have the same basic account structure, and follow the traditional account conventions.
  
- `permanent versus temporary` -- Every account falls under one of two main categories:
  - 1. Permanent
  - 2. Temporary
 
  Permanent accounts are the ones that show up on the balance sheet, and they include assets, liabilities, and equity accounts. These accounts stay in place from year to year, accumulating information the whole time. Temporary accounts show up on the income statement, and they include revenues, costs, and expenses. These accounts only hold on to the information of a single accounting period, however long that period may be.

  At the end of every accounting period, the temporary accounts get folded into permanent accounts, as the net income from the period is added (or subtracted, in the case of a loss) into the appropriate capital account (which depends on the business structure, such as partnership or corporation) Then each temporary account gets zeroed out to start the new period with a clean slate.
  
  What’s the point of this? Well, permanent account balances are measured at a particular time; for instance, the cash balance on January 12. Temporary accounts are measured for a period of time, such as racking up sales during February 2017. Those temporary accounts need to be reset so you can begin tracking them again. Meanwhile, the overall net activity of those temporary accounts needs to be permanently added to the records, 
  
- `nothing but net` -- In the world of accounting, net activity has nothing to do with fishing and everything to do with combining account balances.

- `account numbers keep the order` -- The basic accounting convention, built into virtually every accounting software system—even if you don’t see it—is as follows. Traditionally, asset account numbers start with 1, liability accounts with 2, equity accounts with 3, revenue accounts with 4, cost accounts with 5, and expense accounts with 6. Depending on how many accounts you have overall, you would add anywhere from one to ten digits to a given account. For example, if you have hundreds of asset accounts, you could use a three-digit account numbering system to track your assets, and each of those account numbers would start with 1 to follow that convention: your main cash account might be number 101, your inventory account 120, and your first fixed-asset account 150.

# HOW THE ACCOUNTS CONNECT

- At some point, every type of account will interconnect with each of the others. Every single transaction your business conducts involves at least two accounts, sometimes more, and they most often are of different types. For example, assets will be used to pay for expenses. Inventory products bought on account involve both assets and liabilities. Product sales hit both cost and revenue accounts. Owner withdrawals deplete both assets and equity.

  In addition to that, though, the accounts have to be in perfect balance, like any equation. The company’s total assets must be exactly equal to its combined liabilities and equity. To get to that balance, the net result of combining the revenue, cost, and expense accounts must be folded into the equity account. That perfect balance is clearly displayed on the company’s formal financial statements.
  
- `the formal connection` -- Periodically, you or your accountant will produce a set of financial statements for your company. These statements are formal reports that spell out exactly what has been going on for the preceding period

  Most business owners prepare financial statements at least quarterly so they can pay quarterly estimated income taxes as necessary. There are three main financial statements that you will put together. These statements are:
  - 1. The balance sheet
  - 2. The statement of profit and loss
  - 3. The statement of cash flows

- `the everyday connection` -- For many small businesses, daily transactions include three types of accounts:
  - 1. Revenues
  - 2. Expenses
  - 3. Cash 
  
- `more than two` -- Sometimes a transaction will impact more than two accounts. For example, if you pay for phone service, cable, and Internet all on the same bill, that transaction would affect four accounts: phone expense, cable expense, Internet expense, and cash

- `connections keep the business moving` -- Connections Keep the Business Moving
At the most basic level, both everyday and formal periodic connections among the accounts are what keep your business flowing. In other words, you use a combination of liabilities and equity to purchase assets. Assets are your company’s resources, and you use those assets to create revenue, some directly (like inventory that converts into a sale) and some indirectly (like the computer used to account for the inventory). It’s easy to see a clear link between inventory and revenue production, but seeing how the computer can help bring in revenue isn’t quite as obvious. But your computer does generate revenue when you use it to create invoices, design promotional 

  Expenses also go directly toward revenue production. After all, you can’t run a business without things like phones, electricity, Internet access, and pens. Those revenues and expenses come together in your business, hopefully with revenues greater than expenses, to create additional equity.

# DEBITS AND CREDITS

- One of the most basic—and most confusing (at least at first)—concepts of accounting involves debits and credits. This concept is usually one of the first things taught to accounting students, and is one of the later things that clicks, because at first glance it seems counterintuitive. The debit/credit scheme, though, lies at the heart of every accounting system. Once you have a grasp of how debits and credits work, you will understand much more easily how the whole system works.

- `so what are debits and credits` -- In the world of accounting, debit means left, and credit means right. At first glance, that might seem confusing. But in the beginning of double entry accounting (the modern system we all use now), when everything was done by hand using pencil and paper, it was the only way to go.

  Every single accounting transaction has at least two parts, a debit side and a credit side, and the two have to be equal. Here’s the tricky part. Some accounts are increased by debits; some are decreased. In the same way, some accounts are increased by credits, and 
  
  others are decreased. Whether a debit or credit acts like an addition or subtraction completely depends on the type of account you are working with. Check out the following table to see which accounts work in which ways.
  
  That’s how all business transactions are recorded, based on this ages-old debit/credit accounting system
  
- `inside a T account` -- Here’s how a T account works: The account name goes on top of the T, all debits to that account go on the left side of the T, and all credits on the right. Every time a transaction affected that account, the bookkeeper would record the dollar amount on the appropriate side of the T, debit or credi

- `the banking switcheroo` -- When it comes to personal finances, there’s an extra twist that makes debits and credits seem more confusing than they really are. Think about the cards in your wallet: debit cards and credit cards. They don’t match the traditional scheme because their names weren’t created by accountants, but by bankers, and from their perspective.

  When you use your debit card, it decreases the amount of money you have in your bank account. But it also decreases the amount of money the bank owes you. So from the bank’s perspective, every time you use your debit card, it decreases their liability—and, as you saw on the table, liability accounts decrease with a debit.

  Here’s the twist: Every time you use a credit card, you’re technically borrowing money from the bank. So every swipe increases the amount of money you owe the bank. From the bank’s perspective, they’re extending credit to you. When you pay for things with your credit card, it increases their asset (a receivables account), which increases with a debit.

  On the bank’s side, whether you use a debit card or credit card, the accounts on their books get a debit entry. But on your side, in your personal finances, every time you use either a debit or credit card, your “books” get a credit entry; you’re either decreasing your cash balance with the debit card, or increasing your liabilities with your credit card.
  
- `sometimes it is the opposite in business, too` -- In business accounting, there are some accounts that act in completely the opposite direction of the other accounts in their group when it comes to debits and credits. For example, some asset accounts have normal credit balances, and some sales accounts have normal debit balances. These special accounts are called contra accounts, because they act contrary to the norm (which is how they got that nickname).

  Though contra accounts may seem puzzling, they serve a very clear purpose. They can help you separate certain kinds of transactions from their “parent” account (the account they’re offsetting), giving you a clearer picture of what’s really going on. Sometimes that breakdown is very important, so much so that it can affect your future business strategies and policies.

- `breaking down a transaction` -- Being in business creates an enormous pile of transactions which you’ll learn more about in just a moment. Every one of those transactions has both a debit and a credit component. That does not mean that the transaction necessarily involves a plus and a minus (although that may happen sometimes), or that one account balance will go up while another goes down (which may also happen). Rather, every transaction will have a left-side impact (debit) and a right-side impact (credit). How a transaction affects the relevant accounts depends completely on what kind of accounts they are.

  For example, suppose you write a check to pay the company’s electric bill. That transaction would result in a debit to electricity expense and a credit to cash. Your electricity expense is increased, and cash decreased. If you change that transaction a little, the account impact changes, too. Suppose you paid that electric bill with a credit card; you would still debit the electricity expense, but now the credit would go to an account like “credit card payable,” one of your liability accounts. In this case, the expense 
  
  account increases, and so does the liability account (because now you owe more).

# WHAT COUNTS AS A TRANSACTION

- A business transaction takes place when an event that can be measured in terms of money has occurred. That’s the formal definition, and it takes a bit of unpacking. There are dozens, probably hundreds, of events that happen in every business on any given day that have no monetary effect at all: opening the mail, Skyping with clients, and sending emails, for example. Turning those occurrences into transactions takes only one thing, and that is money. If that envelope you opened held a check from a customer, you have a transaction to record. If that Skype call resulted in a sale, you’d have another transaction.

  Most companies have the same general transactions, and those get repeated all the time. Common transactions include:
  - Making sales
  - • Collecting money
  - • Paying bills
  - • Paying employees
  - • Paying taxes
  - Purchasing supplies
  - • Receiving inventory
  - • Buying equipment
  
- `when to record transactions` -- In accounting, as in most other things, timing is everything. Timing applies to transactions themselves, in two different ways:
  - • The first involves the day the transaction actually took place (for example, you buy a case of copy paper and some toner, and have the office supply store bill your company).
  - • The second comes into play when money changes hands (you send out a check for those office supplies).
  
  You have two distinct options to choose from for your overall accounting method:
  - 1. The cash method, more commonly used by very small businesses and small service businesses, means you only record transactions when money changes hands. Using this method, you wouldn’t record that paper and toner purchase in your books until the day you actually paid the office supply company
  - 2. The accrual method, which many companies have to use, requires that you record transactions as they occur, regardless of the money factor. Under this method, you would write up the transaction on the day you got the office supplies, then use a second transaction to record the payment.
  
  `cash accounting` -- When it comes to choosing an accounting method, especially for a very small business, cash wins hands down over accrual. Why? Because: 
   - • It gives you a little leeway at year-end to minimize taxable income: You can pay a bunch of expenses early to reduce your profits and your tax bill for the year, and you only pay taxes on the cash you have actually received that year.
   - • The actual bookkeeping is much simpler: Since all transactions involve cash, you only need to worry about the other accounts involved in the entry.
   
   There is a very big drawback to this much-preferred method, though: timing. The cash method doesn’t track your revenues and expenses as they happen in real time—only when there’s a payment involved. Knowing exactly when the original transactions occurred could come in very handy for planning purposes
   
   On top of that, some companies are not allowed to use the cash accounting method, according to IRS regulations. According to the IRS, if your company has inventory, you can’t use cash accounting. You also can’t, under IRS guidelines, use this method if your company is formed as a C corporation (also called a regular corporation) or if your gross revenues are more than $5 million a year
   
 - `cash in cash out` -- When you use cash accounting, virtually your entire bookkeeping system can be run through your checking account. As long as every check and every deposit are recorded, you will have most of your daily accounting chores taken care of.
 
 - `Accrual Accounting` -- Using the accrual accounting method is a little bit more complicated than the cash method, but it can provide you with better and timelier information.
 
  The basic rule of accrual accounting is to record transactions as they happen, even if no cash is involved at the time. You record every sale (revenue) as it is earned and every expense as it is incurred. The underlying accounting principle here is called the matching principle. That is, you match revenues and expenses to the period in which they actually took place.

  When you buy supplies on account, you record the transaction on the day you bought the supplies. When you make a sale to a client, you record the sale that day, even if your invoice doesn’t ask him to pay you for another 30 days. Of course, when the cash does eventually change hands, you will have another transaction to record. Having to record those extra entries is one of the drawbacks of accrual accounting
  
   The other drawback has a bigger impact on your bank account, namely you have to pay income taxes on revenues you have earned, even if you have not yet been paid
  
- `timing is everything` -- With the accrual method, the noncash entries are the ones that impact your bottom line. Their purpose is to record revenues and expenses right now. When you do pay those expenses or receive those customer checks, those transactions have no effect on your profits, since the transactions involve only assets and liabilities.
