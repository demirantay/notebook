# INTRODUCTION

- You may not realize it, but accounting is a huge part of your life. If you bought this book, accounting was involved. If you grabbed a latte at Starbucks this morning, accounting was involved. If your grandmother sent you a birthday card with a $20 bill inside, accounting was involved. In fact, accounting kicks in every time you buy or sell something, pay a bill, get a paycheck, or check your bank balance. However money factors into your life, accounting helps put it in perspective. And whether you’re interested in accounting for yourself, your business, or as a high-paying, in-demand career, Accounting 101 will get you started.

  And contrary to the widely held belief that accountants have mind-numbingly boring jobs, accounting is truly one of the most fascinating careers in the world. Here you’ll learn about everything from how the terrified ancient bookkeepers kept tallies for the pharaohs to the way today’s cutting-edge technology is changing the way we look at money.

# The Business of Accounting

- Accounting is known as “the language of finance.” This ancient communication decodes the mysteries of money, translating complex financial concepts into clear, bottom-line numbers that anyone can use

  Despite how complicated businesses and personal finances have become, accounting continues to bring order and comparability to the chaos.
  
  With clear record keeping and reporting rules to follow, accounting unites governments, businesses, and citizens in an economy, and keeps both the relevant information and the money flowin

# WHO USES ACCOUNTING INFORMATION?

- Virtually everybody uses accounting information, in both their professional and personal lives. Every bank statement, credit card bill, and rent check is full of accounting information. When you double-check the charges on your bar tab, and tack on a healthy tip, you’re using accounting. When you shop on Amazon.com, do your taxes, or apply for a student loan, you are providing accounting information. And that’s just the everyday-life way you use accounting.
On the business side, accounting is even more pervasive, and most people use at least some accounting information in their jobs every day. Whether you’re ordering office supplies, making change for customers, or printing the payroll checks, you are dealing with accounting information.
All of these small pieces of accounting data add up to the big picture of how your household or your company is faring financially

  In addition to you, a lot of other people may want to see how you or your business is doing financially
  
  his list of outside users is long, varied, and includes:
  
  Loan officers, for everything from mortgages to student loans to business lines of credit
  • Federal, state, and local tax authorities
  • Potential and existing investors, whether you use crowdfunding or launch a corporate IPO (initial public offering)
  
- `VERYONE WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT` -- While all of these outside users of your accounting information want to take in-depth looks at your financial status, there’s a catch. They don’t all need the same information, and they probably won’t all want it in the same 

  When you’re looking over family finances or the financial picture of your own company, you’ll want to see a lot more detail than you would be willing to show outsiders
  
- `“GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT”` -- When you’re looking over family finances or the financial picture of your own company, you’ll want to see a lot more detail than you would be willing to show outsiders

  We have established that you may have a lot of different people asking to see your personal or business financial statements, and that they may all want to see something different. So what do you do? First, look at who’s doing the asking. If it’s a tax authority, 
  
  For example, you have to report your income tax on Form 1040; you can’t simply send them a printout of numbers from your paystub. The same goes for loan officers: These professionals may look at hundreds of financial statements every week, and they need them to be consistent
  
  Their needs matter to you as well. If you don’t send in the right tax forms to the IRS, you could be subjected to fines, penalties, and interest. Worse, you could be called in for an audit.
  
- `Only Answer What You’re Asked` -- If you fill out your own tax forms, a good rule to remember is this: Don’t supply more information than the forms ask for. Fill in all the requested numbers, then stop. Don’t When you include extra information, you could be 

  flagging your return for audit. Audits aren’t necessarily bad—they could show you did everything correctly—but they’re generally not pleasant.
  
- `Two set of books` -- Two sets of books is most often talked about in connection with companies, and their use is more common than you might expect. The truth is that many companies keep one set of books for tax purposes, and another for everyday in-house accounting. Of course, today these “books” are really made up of computer programs, but the same idea holds true
  - 1. First, computerization has made it incredibly easy to track numbers in multiple ways.
  - 2. Second, what makes sense for taxes, namely minimizing the tax bill, may not make sense for other reasons, like reporting income to investors or trying to borrow money.
  
  For internal purposes, you may want to use the most realistic numbers, even if those would leave you with a bigger tax burden. Although, when it comes to income taxes, everyone wants to show the lowest possible income because that means the lowest possible tax bill.
