# INTRODUCTION

- You may not realize it, but accounting is a huge part of your life. If you bought this book, accounting was involved. If you grabbed a latte at Starbucks this morning, accounting was involved. If your grandmother sent you a birthday card with a $20 bill inside, accounting was involved. In fact, accounting kicks in every time you buy or sell something, pay a bill, get a paycheck, or check your bank balance. However money factors into your life, accounting helps put it in perspective. And whether you’re interested in accounting for yourself, your business, or as a high-paying, in-demand career, Accounting 101 will get you started.

  And contrary to the widely held belief that accountants have mind-numbingly boring jobs, accounting is truly one of the most fascinating careers in the world. Here you’ll learn about everything from how the terrified ancient bookkeepers kept tallies for the pharaohs to the way today’s cutting-edge technology is changing the way we look at money.
  
  Now, along with doing taxes and auditing financial statements, accounting careers include working at the FBI, developing environmental outreach plans, and steering international corporate finances.

# The Business of Accounting

- Accounting is known as “the language of finance.” This ancient communication decodes the mysteries of money, translating complex financial concepts into clear, bottom-line numbers that anyone can use

  Despite how complicated businesses and personal finances have become, accounting continues to bring order and comparability to the chaos.
  
  With clear record keeping and reporting rules to follow, accounting unites governments, businesses, and citizens in an economy, and keeps both the relevant information and the money flowin

# WHO USES ACCOUNTING INFORMATION?

- Virtually everybody uses accounting information, in both their professional and personal lives. Every bank statement, credit card bill, and rent check is full of accounting information. When you double-check the charges on your bar tab, and tack on a healthy tip, you’re using accounting. When you shop on Amazon.com, do your taxes, or apply for a student loan, you are providing accounting information. And that’s just the everyday-life way you use accounting.
On the business side, accounting is even more pervasive, and most people use at least some accounting information in their jobs every day. Whether you’re ordering office supplies, making change for customers, or printing the payroll checks, you are dealing with accounting information.
All of these small pieces of accounting data add up to the big picture of how your household or your company is faring financially

  In addition to you, a lot of other people may want to see how you or your business is doing financially
  
  his list of outside users is long, varied, and includes:
  
  Loan officers, for everything from mortgages to student loans to business lines of credit
  • Federal, state, and local tax authorities
  • Potential and existing investors, whether you use crowdfunding or launch a corporate IPO (initial public offering)
  
- `VERYONE WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT` -- While all of these outside users of your accounting information want to take in-depth looks at your financial status, there’s a catch. They don’t all need the same information, and they probably won’t all want it in the same 

  When you’re looking over family finances or the financial picture of your own company, you’ll want to see a lot more detail than you would be willing to show outsiders
  
- `“GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT”` -- When you’re looking over family finances or the financial picture of your own company, you’ll want to see a lot more detail than you would be willing to show outsiders

  We have established that you may have a lot of different people asking to see your personal or business financial statements, and that they may all want to see something different. So what do you do? First, look at who’s doing the asking. If it’s a tax authority, 
  
  For example, you have to report your income tax on Form 1040; you can’t simply send them a printout of numbers from your paystub. The same goes for loan officers: These professionals may look at hundreds of financial statements every week, and they need them to be consistent
  
  Their needs matter to you as well. If you don’t send in the right tax forms to the IRS, you could be subjected to fines, penalties, and interest. Worse, you could be called in for an audit.
  
- `Only Answer What You’re Asked` -- If you fill out your own tax forms, a good rule to remember is this: Don’t supply more information than the forms ask for. Fill in all the requested numbers, then stop. Don’t When you include extra information, you could be 

  flagging your return for audit. Audits aren’t necessarily bad—they could show you did everything correctly—but they’re generally not pleasant.
  
- `Two set of books` -- Two sets of books is most often talked about in connection with companies, and their use is more common than you might expect. The truth is that many companies keep one set of books for tax purposes, and another for everyday in-house accounting. Of course, today these “books” are really made up of computer programs, but the same idea holds true
  - 1. First, computerization has made it incredibly easy to track numbers in multiple ways.
  - 2. Second, what makes sense for taxes, namely minimizing the tax bill, may not make sense for other reasons, like reporting income to investors or trying to borrow money.
  
  For internal purposes, you may want to use the most realistic numbers, even if those would leave you with a bigger tax burden. Although, when it comes to income taxes, everyone wants to show the lowest possible income because that means the lowest possible tax bill.

# ACCOUNTING IS MORE THAN NUMBERS

- When you think “accounting,” you probably picture a report filled with numbers. After all, that’s where accounting always starts. When you dig a little deeper, though, you’ll see that those numbers only set the foundation for what accounting really is: a way to analyze and make sense of an endless stream of information so that we can make well-informed decisions.

  Accounting squirms its way into your personal life, too, and just like with businesses, it’s not just about spreadsheets and reports full of numbers. From clipping coupons to saving for a family vacation to stopping for a latte on the way to work, these numbers touch almost everything in your life, every day. There’s a more formal side to accounting in personal matters, too. You’ll see this side when you:
  • Apply for student loans
  • Put a percentage of your paycheck in a 401(k) plan
  • Do your income taxes
  • Create a family budget
  
- `STARTING A BUSINESS` -- If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, you’re not alone. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there are 28.8 million small businesses that help keep the American economy afloat—and, for all of these businesses, accounting is necessary from Day 1. It’s true! As soon as you begin to plan your business launch, accounting takes center stage

  The framework for every small business startup is a thorough business plan, complete with an honest assessment of assets, a realistic view of expectations, and pro forma financial statements
  
  Once the business is up and running, you need to keep accounting at the forefront. Yes, the day-to-day responsibilities can result in overlooked bookkeeping tasks, but that work must be completed and kept current if the business has any chance of success. Without up-to-date accounting, you can’t plan properly for the future of your company, or analyze its wins and losses.
  
- `Top Ten Small Business Accounting Mistakes` -- Don’t fall into the same traps that have caused thousands of small businesses to fail. These traps include:
  - 1. Not knowing your true cash balance: Due to things like automatic payments, outstanding checks, and bank charges, money that appears in your cash drawer and your checking account may already be spent.
  - 2. Extending credit without checking credit: Until you collect some basic credit information about a customer, don’t make on-account sales, where your company extends credit (rather than getting paid immediately with cash or credit card) and bills the customer later. A sale isn’t much good if your company never gets paid
  - 3. Mistaking profits for cash: When your company makes a lot of credit (or on-account) sales, your company can post big profits without seeing any cash. When you make a sale, it counts toward revenue and profits, even if your company hasn’t yet gotten paid by the customer. But you can’t pay your bills with profits; you can only pay them with cash
  - 4. Paying bills too soon: If your vendors give you 30 days to pay them, take it. Unless you get a discount for paying early, paying your bills only when they’re due improves your company’s cash flow. Because cash is so precious to new and small business owners, having as much easily available cash as possible can help you stay solvent, especially when unexpected expenses come up.
  - 5. Avoiding bookkeeping tasks: Not recording transactions regularly can leave you with a mountain of bookkeeping to deal with instead of a molehill. Plus, the time lag can act like a vacuum, where transaction records disappear and the transactions never are recorded.
  - 6. Not hiring a payroll service: The minor cost of hiring out this task provides a huge benefit for your company. It can free up your time, and help your company avoid financial penalties from state and federal agencies that go along with late and incorrect payroll tax filings.
  - 7. . Paying accidental dividends: Every time a corporation owner takes money out of his business, it counts as a dividend (an official distribution from the corporation to the shareholder; all corporation owners are called shareholders). That can lead to a bigger personal income tax bill, because dividends are included in taxable income.
  - 8. Not keeping personal finances separate from business: Mixing up business and personal money can cause both bookkeeping and legal problems. On the bookkeeping side, paying personal expenses with business money causes a dividend or distribution, and that can confuse the accounting entries. On the legal side, mixing the two can take away the personal financial protection gained by incorporating or forming an LLC (both of which are designed to shield your personal money from business lawsuits).
  - 9. Setting prices too low: If you don’t know your costs before you set product or service prices, you run the risk of losing money on every sale. A simple break-even analysis can help you set prices at a profitable level. For example, if you order fifty clocks to sell in your store, you need to take into account things like sales tax, delivery fees, and overhead expenses related to the clocks to come up with the real, break-even price.
  - 10.  Turning over all the financial stuff to someone else: Without an intimate knowledge of your company’s finances, you can’t make successful decisions. Even if you don’t want to deal with the daily bookkeeping tasks, look at your financial statements every month so that you can plan for profits and prevent potential problems.
