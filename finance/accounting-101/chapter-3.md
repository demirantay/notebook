# ANTI–MONEY LAUNDERING SPECIALISTS

- Money from illegal enterprises fuels terrorist and criminal organizations around the world. Literally trillions of dollars of illegal trade takes place every year, and the kingpins have gotten very adept at concealing their money trails. While you may think that their biggest financial challenge is bringing in more cash, what actually causes them problems is transforming the dirty money from illegal activities into squeaky clean, perfectly legal funds. That process is called money laundering, and tracking that cash has opened up a whole new branch of accounting for people called Certified Anti–Money Laundering Specialists (CAMS).

- `Its a dirty job` -- Anti–money laundering specialists are tasked with a nearly impossible mission. Chasing down laundered money has gotten increasingly difficult as more criminals use the Internet to cover up their illicit activities. Online banking and payment services, mobile phone money transfers, and virtual funds (like bitcoins) make it harder than ever to uncover illegal transactions.

  It’s no wonder these specialists earn top annual salaries, which average somewhere around the $100,000 mark. Many of these dedicated professionals work right where the money is, at financial institutions
  
   But actually laundering money doesn’t require quite as much brainpower. In fact, once a successful laundering operation is set up, the money practically washes itself.
   - 1. Placement—moving money into the legitimate financial system
   - 2. Layering—breaking up dirty money into small amounts and shuffling it around to obscure its path
   - 3. Integration—getting the money back from “clean” sources
   
   Money launderers commonly create or use cash-based businesses (such as vending machines or laundromats) to scrub their illegal funds
   
    The criminal business owner simply adds some dirty cash to the company’s legitimate daily receipts, and then deposits the money all together in the business bank account for later distribution back to the owner. In other cases, they may buy portable and hard-to-track commodities (like diamonds), and sell them in another jurisdiction to clean their cash. Online auctions and gambling sites are also used frequently to launder money.
    
 - `backtraking from clean to dirty` -- Despite the many laws and regulations that have been put in place, money launderers continue to find new ways to clean their dirty funds. The trail always starts with a transaction or detail that strikes the specialist as suspicious He may be tipped off to the transaction by an informant, or notice that a person’s means doesn’t match his lifestyle
 
- `smurfs` -- smurfs are money launderers who move small, undetectable amounts of dirty money. They may carry it in suitcases across international borders, or make dozens of deposits across a region

# CFOS STEER CORPORATIONS

- CEOs (or Chief Executive Officers) get all the glory. But it’s the CFOs, the Chief Financial Officers, who keep the corporate wheels turning. These are the money guys, the ones who set the big-picture financial strategies for companies, from R & D (research and development) budgets to tax planning to IPOs (initial public offerings).
