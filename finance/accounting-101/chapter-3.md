# ANTI–MONEY LAUNDERING SPECIALISTS

- Money from illegal enterprises fuels terrorist and criminal organizations around the world. Literally trillions of dollars of illegal trade takes place every year, and the kingpins have gotten very adept at concealing their money trails. While you may think that their biggest financial challenge is bringing in more cash, what actually causes them problems is transforming the dirty money from illegal activities into squeaky clean, perfectly legal funds. That process is called money laundering, and tracking that cash has opened up a whole new branch of accounting for people called Certified Anti–Money Laundering Specialists (CAMS).

- `Its a dirty job` -- Anti–money laundering specialists are tasked with a nearly impossible mission. Chasing down laundered money has gotten increasingly difficult as more criminals use the Internet to cover up their illicit activities. Online banking and payment services, mobile phone money transfers, and virtual funds (like bitcoins) make it harder than ever to uncover illegal transactions.

  It’s no wonder these specialists earn top annual salaries, which average somewhere around the $100,000 mark. Many of these dedicated professionals work right where the money is, at financial institutions
  
   But actually laundering money doesn’t require quite as much brainpower. In fact, once a successful laundering operation is set up, the money practically washes itself.
   - 1. Placement—moving money into the legitimate financial system
   - 2. Layering—breaking up dirty money into small amounts and shuffling it around to obscure its path
   - 3. Integration—getting the money back from “clean” sources
   
   Money launderers commonly create or use cash-based businesses (such as vending machines or laundromats) to scrub their illegal funds
   
    The criminal business owner simply adds some dirty cash to the company’s legitimate daily receipts, and then deposits the money all together in the business bank account for later distribution back to the owner. In other cases, they may buy portable and hard-to-track commodities (like diamonds), and sell them in another jurisdiction to clean their cash. Online auctions and gambling sites are also used frequently to launder money.
    
 - `backtraking from clean to dirty` -- Despite the many laws and regulations that have been put in place, money launderers continue to find new ways to clean their dirty funds. The trail always starts with a transaction or detail that strikes the specialist as suspicious He may be tipped off to the transaction by an informant, or notice that a person’s means doesn’t match his lifestyle
 
- `smurfs` -- smurfs are money launderers who move small, undetectable amounts of dirty money. They may carry it in suitcases across international borders, or make dozens of deposits across a region

# CFOS STEER CORPORATIONS

- CEOs (or Chief Executive Officers) get all the glory. But it’s the CFOs, the Chief Financial Officers, who keep the corporate wheels turning. These are the money guys, the ones who set the big-picture financial strategies for companies, from R & D (research and development) budgets to tax planning to IPOs (initial public offerings).

  He also deals directly with taxing and regulatory agencies like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).
  
  Crucial decisions are made based on the information provided by the CFO, such as:
  - Expansion plans
  - • Downsizing and layoffs
  - • Acquisitions and mergers
  - • Stock offerings
  - • Debt financing
  - • Major asset purchases
  
- `keeping the doors open` -- While informing everyone about the company’s financial condition takes up a good deal of the CFO’s time, his most important duty is keeping those finances above water. This part of the job was once done by someone holding the title of “treasurer,” but it now falls into the CFO’s domain.

 At the most basic level, these treasury duties call on the CFO to manage the company’s money, making him the key responsibility holder when it comes to its current financial condition
 
 Among those duties, the CFO must  Determine where to invest the company’s funds
  - • Ensure the company has enough liquidity to meet current obligations
  - • Figure out the most advantageous combination of debt and equity financing
  - • Engage in financial planning and analysis to 
 
 Without a keen sense of how money flows in and out of the company, and a high-level understanding of the industry and the overall economy, a CFO could run the business into the ground. That’s why only the most insightful, experienced financial accountants are able to do this demanding job well.
 
- To accomplish these goals, the CFO creates financial models to evaluate different scenarios, and then predicts which will be most advantageous for the company. The success of the company hinges on how accurate those models are, and how well the CFO is able to anticipate upcoming economic events.

# TAX ACCOUNTANTS

- Most people only think about their income taxes in March or April. Tax accountants think about them all year round, and that pays off for you in a big way. These savvy professionals keep up-to-the-minute tabs on frequently changing tax laws and scour the tax code looking for ways to help their clients get bigger refunds. 

  And while popular tax prep mills give their representatives at least some basic training, that training is usually focused more on using the company’s proprietary software than in understanding the tax laws and utilizing money-saving strategies for clients. These enterprises emphasize volume, trying to churn out as many tax returns as possible, instead of paying attention to high-quality personalized service.
  
  A seasoned tax accountant, particularly a CPA, will cost more than do-it-yourself software or tax preparation chain stores. However, if your financial picture is more complex than a W-2 and a standard deduction, it may be well worth the expense to hire a qualified professional tax accountant who can find you even bigger tax savings for the current year and beyond. The bottom line is, you really get what you pay for.
  
- `tax avoidance: the american way` -- Here’s the golden rule of taxes: Tax evasion is illegal; tax avoidance is the American way. While tax avoidance sounds illegal, it’s not. What it really means is figuring out the absolute minimum taxes you owe legally using existing laws, deductions, and loopholes.

  CPAs know that the best way to slash your tax bill is to reduce your taxable income as far down as it will go.
  
  Taking advantage of every available tax credit
  - • Maximizing tax-free income
  - • Shifting income
  - • Maximizing deductions
  - • Deferring taxes

  Your tax accountant will identify which of these strategies you can use to minimize your income tax bill. Some are incredibly simple to employ, others can be tricky, and truly call for professional guidance. As long as there’s no fraud, theft, or deception involved, you’re well within your rights to avoid paying even a penny more in taxes than you have to.
  
- `tax identitiy theft on the rise` --  During the 2016 tax season, nearly 60 percent of CPAs surveyed had at least one client who had fallen victim to this fraud, according to the Journal of Accountancy

  Here’s how the scam works: A criminal gets hold of some basic personal information, including a social security number. Then they go to the IRS website to get a copy of the individual’s tax return from the previous year. This gives them a wealth of additional information. The thief then uses that information to create and file a fake tax return, directing the refund to himself. When the real taxpayer goes to file his return, it’s rejected because a refund has already been issued to that social security number. As you can imagine, it’s very difficult to resolve this problem and get the refund that’s really owed to you.
  
- `this is not the IRS` -- The IRS doesn’t contact people by text, email, or social media to inform them about tax issues. The agency also doesn’t demand payment over the phone. If someone claiming to be from the IRS contacts you in any of those ways, don’t buy it. It’s a scam.

- `audit help` -- Should you have the misfortune of being called in to the IRS for an audit, your tax accountant—as long as he’s a CPA—will be there to represent you, right by your side, taking charge of the meeting.

  Many times, issues with your tax return can be resolved with some paperwork, and won’t involve a visit to the local IRS field office. Contrary to TV dramas, audits rarely end in criminal proceedings or bankruptcy; they almost always involve simple mistakes or questionable deductions.
  
  You can go it alone, bring your CPA with you, or your CPA can appear without you (saving you the stress of coming face to face with the IRS auditor)
  
   If you get a call or letter (by postal mail, never email) from the IRS, you must respond within 30 days; every day of nonresponse after that tacks on interest charges.
   
- `red flags to watch out` -- As software has made basic tax return completion easier, virtually anyone can hang out a shingle as a professional tax preparer. That does not mean, however, that they know what they’re doing, or that they’ve had any training at all

  red flags to watch out for include:
  - • The preparer refuses to sign the tax return
  - • The preparer doesn’t have a valid PTIN (Preparer Tax Identification Number)
  - • You’re asked to sign a blank or incomplete return
  - • The preparer recommends direct-depositing the refund into an account that’s not yours
  - • The preparer doesn’t e-file your return
  -  The preparer asks to see your last paystub rather than your W-2
  
  These unscrupulous tax preparers can pocket your refund, steal or sell your identity, or ruin your credit.

# ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTANTS

- Sometimes the cost of doing business includes damage to the environment, an issue that’s increasingly taking center stage. As concern grows and regulations get more complex, environmental accountants step in to weigh those costs against profits, reputations, and future business. In the best cases, environmental accountants can help save the planet while increasing company profits.

- `the 62billion cleanup` -- The Deepwater Horizon oil spill—then the largest spill in American history—splashed across headlines in April 2010. The BP rig exploded in the Gulf of 

  Mexico, killing eleven workers and releasing millions of barrels of oil into the water. In October 2015, BP agreed to pay more than $20 billion in settlement claims, bringing the total cleanup price tag to nearly $62 billion.
  
  The clothing industry, for example, uses a lot of hazardous chemicals when creating their fashions, from the pesticides used in cotton farming to the toxic dyes that color our clothe Those are just a few of the ways industries can impact our environment and environmental concerns can affect a company’s bottom line.
  
- `what exactly is an enviroenmental cost` -- In the accounting world, though, these costs center on business and money in the form of lost profits, bad publicity, government fines, and expensive cleanups. Specific environmental cost considerations (in the accounting sense) include things like:
  -  Evaluating alternative chemicals, as one may cost more initially but cause less damage down the line
  - • Finding different disposal methods for toxic substances to prevent exorbitant cleanup costs
  - Considering alternative power sources (such as solar or wind) to cut down on air pollution
  
- `compliance laws` -- In addition to traditional accounting skills like math prowess and attention to detail, environmental accountants must also have a thorough understanding of very complex compliance laws and very technical scientific material. They use accepted accounting principles to figure out the costs of environmental disasters and cleanup (like when an oil pipeline bursts), as well as model and predict potential future issues.

# CHOOSING THE RIGHT PROFESSIONAL

- Once you decide you want to turn to an accountant for help, your next step is to figure out what level of help you’re looking for and what specialty areas you need. Doing that will point you toward the right kind of professional. You may use a mix of professionals. For example, you might hire a bookkeeper to handle the day-to-day data entry for your business and have a tax professional to do your business and personal income tax returns at year-end; or you may decide to do all of the basic bookkeeping tasks in-house, but hire out the payroll processing. Taking an honest look at what you can do, what you want to do, and what you probably won’t do (at least not regularly) will help you decide whom you need to hire.

  You must feel confident that your accountant knows what she’s talking about, that you are getting sound advice, and that you can trust your accountant with a lot of highly confidential information.
  
- `checking the credentials` -- Before you hire a CPA, especially if you just picked him out of the phone book, you should verify his license to practice. You can check the status of any CPA’s license with the appropriate state licensing board.

  CPA licenses can be suspended or revoked for dozens of reasons. For example, simply failing to renew a license on time, neglecting to update contact information, or not keeping up with annual CPE (continuing professional education) 
  
  A quick way to verify a CPA license without struggling to find the right page on a tough-to-maneuver government website, is to visit the CPAverify.org website (www.cpaverify.org). If you know the accountant’s first and last name, you can find all the states he’s licensed in with a single click.
  
- `the money factor` -- When you’re looking to hire an accountant, cost is definitely something to keep in mind. As you would expect, higher-level services such as tax planning cost more than lower-level services such as bookkeeping data entry. Higher-level professionals may offer lower-level services, but there’s a pretty good chance that they will charge more than the going rate, even if they do charge less than their standard rate

  In most cases, CPAs charge more for their services than do any other professionals in the accounting industry. The more letters attached to their names, such as CIA (Capital Investment Advisor), the higher the fees climb.
  
  CPAs and accountants charge relatively high hourly fees, and some may have graduated fee structures based on specific tasks. Creating reports and similar tasks are likely to fall toward the lower end of that scale, but exactly where they fall depends on the complexity of both your business and the volume of reporting requirements.
  
  On the plus side, every dime you spend here is fully deductible on your company’s income tax return.
  
- `your cofort level matters` -- Choosing an accountant involves more than Googling “accountants near me” and calling around for prices. The professional you choose may become intimately involved in your business and in your personal finances.

  It’s important to pick someone you can trust, both to lead you and your company in the right direction and to honor the confidentiality of sensitive and sometimes personal financial information. You want to choose someone who has a lot of experience with the specific services you need, and with businesses like yours. An accountant who specializes in retail shops, for example, may not be the best choice for a physical therapy and massage group.
  
  You should feel secure asking questions about anything that could affect your company our accountant should be someone you’d go out to lunch with or bring along to a ball gam
