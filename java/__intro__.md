## Java
<br>

- This is how you write the famous "Hello, World!"
  ```java
   public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello, World!");
     }
   }
   ```
   Every piece of code in java must be written inside classes. The class name is the file name and you must have at least one `public static void main(..){..} ` function since the language needs a entry point for the program.
