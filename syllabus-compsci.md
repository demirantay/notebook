# CompSci Syllabus

The syllabus is divided into sections. The first section is the basic theorotical resources that every software engineer should know. The following sections are my own preferred choosings (each section is divided with hr lines).

For [finding the books](http://freecomputerbooks.com/)

- [ ] Start contributing to Remote Companies Open Source projects 
- [ ] Think of this as Duolingo tree, you can reset them all and re-do them with more advanced notes. You are never done.

## Section 3

 Market Skills Road Map

 It is important to learn in this sequence 1-Intro, 2-Backend, 3-Frontend, 4-DevOps. And do not try to build atleast one thing after learning each subject.

 ### Intro
 These are the basic and essential skills that every developer shoould have it under their belt in todays market. Try to practice what you learn.

 - [X] Git - Version Control
 - [X] GitHub for public repos, GitLab for private 
 - [X] Basic Terminal Usage
 - [X] Licenses
 - [X] Semantatic Versioning
 - [X] HTTP/HTTPS
 - [X] Design Patterns (SOLID, KISS, YAGNI) -- skipped for now
 

 ### Front End
 This may seem basic since in the core there are only three technologies how ever what is really hard is that not everyone has the eye for killer design skills.

- [X] HTML, after the basics learn these key points: writing semantic HTML, basic SEO, Accsessibilty
- [ ] CSS, after the basics learn these: Making layouts, Media Queries, CSS 3
- [ ] Javascript, after learning the language ([tutorias on point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/)) learn the following: DOM API, fetching API with Ajax, ES6+modular javscript
- [ ] Learn pacakage managers (either one npm or yarn)
- [ ] Learn CSS pre-processors such as SASS or POST CSS
- [ ] Learn CSS frameworks: Boostrap is the most used option
- [ ] Learn about CSS architecture: BEM
- [ ] Build tools: learn about Linters and Formatters (Prettier, ESLint .etc.)
- [ ] Build tools: learn about module bundlers(webpack)
- [ ] Build tools: learn about task runners (npm scripts)
- [ ] Learn a js framework (React, agnular, vue
- [ ] Learn about CSS in JS : styled components, CSS modules, Emotion, Radium, Glamarous
- [ ] Learn how to test your frontend apps
- [ ] Progressive Web Apps: Learn different web APIs : Storage, web scokets, service workers, location, notification, device orientation, payment, credentials
- [ ] Progressive Web Apps: Learn about monitoring and improving performance: PRPL patter, RAil model, performence metrics, light house, dev tools
- [ ] Learn about type checkers (typescript)
- [ ] Learn about serveri side rendering with your framework of choice
- [ ] Static site generators
- [ ] Desktop Applications (electron)
- [ ] Optional mobile applications with frontend (react native)
- [ ] Do a very advanced project and use everything you have learned so far.

 ### Back End
 It may seem daunting compared to front-end however and yes it is true that there is a learning curve. However it is a lot more fun to be able to understand what the fuck is going under all of this complexity.

 - [X] Learn : Pick a language for backend you may chose Scripting languages: Python, Ruby, PHP, Node or Functional languages: Haskell, Scala .. etc. or Multiparadigm langauges: Go, Rust or Enterprisey languages: Java, C#
 - [X] Practice: Exercise and make some command line application. Sample ideas, you can make a web scraper or get a API in JSON format and create someting, think of a daily task and automate it.
 - [X] Learn: Learn how to use a package manager for the language you have picked e.g. Python has pip etc.
 - [X] Learn: Standards and best practices. Each language has it is own e.g. Python has PEP
 - [X] Project: Make and Distribute some package / Library.
 - [X] Learn: Learn about testing. There are several ways to write tests such as unit , integration ..etc. Tests are very important do not skim through articles. Learn how to calculate test covarege.
 - [X] Project: Write tests for your package built above.
 - [X] Learn Relational Databases there are many options but pick either PostgreSQL or MySQL
 - [ ] Learn: a Framework e.g. Django, Flask
 - [ ] Project: Make a CRUD application with the framework of your chosing
 - [ ] Learn: a noSQL database you do not have to use it but understand how it is different from relational databases and why they are needed. MongoDB is a solid choice.
 - [ ] Learn: Caching, learn how to implenet app level caching using Redis or Memcached
 - [ ] Project: Implement caching to the application you have built above.
 - [ ] Project: Understand REST and learn how to make RESTful APIs and make sure you read about REST from the original paper of Roy Fielding
 - [ ] Learn: Authentication/Authorization methodiolgies. There are many choices such as OAuth, Token Auth, JWT ..etc. you can choose once you understand more about authentication.
 - [ ] Learn: about Message Brokers, understand the "why?" and pick one. There are multiple options but RabbitMQ and Kafka is solid options.
 - [ ] Learn: As the application grows simple queries on your database arent going to cut it out and you will have to resort to a search engine. There are many options like Solr, ElasticSearch pick one after you learn about the topic more.
 - [ ] Learn: How to use Docker
 - [ ] Learn: Knowledge of Web Servers, There are several different options look at the differnt options understand differneces and limitations. Apache, Nginx .. etc.
 - [ ] Learn: how to use Web Sockets.
 - [ ] Project: Make sometinhg using web sockets.
 - [ ] Learn: GraphQL, this is not required and optional feel free to have a loot and what it is all about and why they are calling it the new REST
 - [ ] Learn: Again option, look into Graph Databases, at least you can have a little udnerstanding of what they are.
 - [ ] We have a lot more stuff like Profiling, Static Analysis, DDD SOAP, etc. Go on your journey now!
 - [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH ALGORITHMS HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#algorithms)
 - [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH CODE UNIVERSITY HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#code-university)
 - [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH DATABASE HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#databases)
 - [ ] Project: Once you are done doing all of the above with django create your own framwork with wsgi or cgi and implement each box again with more advanced projects. You can also create your own server, backup it deploy it and use it to build applicaitons with your newly built framework.

### DevOps

DevOps is something very complex instead of having a one strict route you cna carve your way up however it is very important to have a mental map of dev ops that consists of these. Try to understand each topic and atleast do a small lite demo of the things you like for practice.

- [ ] Learn a Systems Programming language like : C/C++, Go, Rust
- [ ] Understand different Operating Systems concepts: Process Management, Threads and Concurrency, Sockets, I/O management, Virtualization, Memory/Storage, File Systems

- [ ] Termianl: learn either Vim, Nano, Emacs, powershell
- [ ] Terminal: Compiling apps from the source 
- [ ] Terminal: Learn about System Performance commands
- [ ] Terminal: Learn about Text Manipulation Tools commands 
- [ ] Terminal: learn about Process Monitoring commands
- [ ] Terminal: learn about Network commands

- [ ] Learn setting up a reverse proxy, forward proxy, caching servver, load balancer, firewall
- [ ] Learn about web servers (apache, nginx, etc.)
- [ ] Infustructure as Code: Learn about Containers (docker ,etc.)
- [ ] Infustructure as Code: learn about Configuration Management (ansible , etc.)
- [ ] Infustructure as Code: learn about Container Orchestration (kubernetees .etc.)
- [ ] Infustructure as Code: learn about Infustructure Provisoning (terraform)
- [ ] Learn some CI/CD Tool (Jenkins ...etc.)
- [ ] Monitoring Software: learn about Infustructure Monitoring (Nagios, etc.)
- [ ] Monitoring Software: learn about Application Monitoring (NEw relic ..etc)
- [ ] Monitoring Software: learn about Logs Management (ELK stack etc.)
- [ ] Learn about CLOUD providers (AWS, azure, digital ocean ... etc.)
- [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH OPERATING SYSTEMS HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#operating-systems)
- [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH NETWORKING HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#computer-networking)
- [ ] Course : FINISH THE REST OF THE SECTION 1 ABOVE
- [ ] Project : Redo all boxes with a lot more advanced projects
- [ ] START LEARNING FINANCE AND WORKING ON YOUR BRAND (human universals)
