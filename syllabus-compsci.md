# CompSci Syllabus

The syllabus is divided into sections. The first section is the basic theorotical resources that every software engineer should know. The following sections are my own preferred choosings (each section is divided with hr lines).

## Section 3

 Market Skills Road Map

 It is important to learn in this sequence 1-Intro, 2-Backend, 3-Frontend, 4-DevOps. And do not try to build atleast one thing after learning each subject.

 ### Intro
 These are the basic and essential skills that every developer shoould have it under their belt in todays market. Try to practice what you learn.

 - [X] Git - Version Control
 - [ ] GitHub for public repos, GitLab for private (fix readmes)
 - [ ] API's
 - [X] Basic Terminal Usage
 - [ ] SOLID. KISS, YAGNI
 - [ ] Licenses
 - [ ] Semantatic Versioning
 - [ ] HTTP/HTTPS
 - [ ] Design Patterns
 - [ ] Character Encodings
 - [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH ALGORITHMS HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#algorithms)

 ### Front End
 This may seem basic since in the core there are only three technologies how ever what is really hard is that not everyone has the eye for killer design skills.

 - [ ] Learn : HTML
 - [ ] HTML : Clone a template content
 - [ ] Learn : CSS
 - [ ] CSS : Learn how to use 'grid' and 'flexbox' -- skipped since I use bootstraps- 12 grid system
 - [ ] CSS : Learn Media Queries and Responsive Design
 - [ ] CSS : Style the template you made above
 - [ ] Learn : JavaScript
 - [ ] JS : Learn the DOM api and how to manipulate it
 - [ ] JS : finish YDKJS books for understanding hoisting, bubling ... etc. there are 10 min papares in your stars
 - [ ] JS : Learn Ajax(XHR)
 - [ ] JS : Learn ES6 and writing modular javascript
 - [ ] Project : Make a fine Responsive website with interactivity with javascript
 - [ ] JS : Pick a package manager and learn it, either `npm` or `yarn`
 - [ ] CSS : Learn SASS a css proprecessor that lets you do things css can't do it by it self
 - [ ] CSS : Learn BootStrap a framework for responive design
 - [ ] CSS : Learn BEM, a css architecture to stucture your css code
 - [ ] Learn : Build tools in this order, 1: NPM scripts, 2: ESLint, 3:Webpack
 - [ ] Project : Create a library and publish it on npm and github
 - [ ] Learn : Pick a framework from this three, 1:React--redux, 2:Vue--vuex, 3:Angular2--Rx.js
 - [ ] Project : You now know what a modern javascript developer should now. Go build a fully developed front end application.
 - [ ] Learn : How to imporove the performance of your application built above such as, eg. Interactivity time, Page speed index, Lighthouse Score.
 - [ ] Learn : Testing your front end applications [here is a good resource](https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-in-2018-f68950900bc3)
 - [ ] Learn : To make progressive web apps, you need to learn about service workers to make them
 - [ ] Learn : Static Type Checkers, you dont need to learn them but they give you overrpower of your code, `TypeScript` is a good option
 - [ ] Learn : Server side rendering in whatever framework you have chosen. If it is 1:react -- Next.js, 2:vue -- Nuxt.js, 3:Angular2 -- Universal
 - [ ] ETC : There are lots of things to learn go figure such as, Canvas, HTML5 APIs, SVG, Functional Programming .. etc.

 ### Back End
 It may seem daunting compared to front-end however and yes it is true that there is a learning curve. However it is a lot more fun to be able to understand what the fuck is going under all of this complexity.

 - [X] Learn : Pick a language for backend you may chose Scripting languages: Python, Ruby, PHP, Node or Functional languages: Haskell, Scala .. etc. or Multiparadigm langauges: Go, Rust or Enterprisey languages: Java, C#
 - [X] Practice: Exercise and make some command line application. Sample ideas, you can make a web scraper or get a API in JSON format and create someting, think of a daily task and automate it.
 - [ ] Learn: Learn how to use a package manager for the language you have picked e.g. Python has pip etc.
 - [X] Learn: Standards and best practices. Each language has it is own e.g. Python has PEP
 - [ ] Projeect: Make and Distribute some package / Library.
 - [ ] Learn: Learn about testing. There are several ways to write tests such as unit , integration ..etc. Tests are very important do not skim through articles. Learn how to calculate test covarege.
 - [ ] Project: Write tests for your package built above.
 - [ ] Learn Relational Databases there are many options but pick either PostgreSQL or MySQL
 - [ ] ProjectCreate a simple CRUD web applciation like a blog or something using everything you have learnt this far. It should have a registration, adminpanel, posts ...etc.
 - [ ] Learn: a Framework e.g. Django, Flask
 - [ ] Project: Make the application you made above with the framework you chose.
 - [ ] Learn: a noSQL database you do not have to use it but understand how it is different from relational databases and why they are needed. MongoDB is a solid choice.
 - [ ] Learn: Caching, learn how to implenet app level caching using Redis or Memcached
 - [ ] Project: Implement caching to the application you have built above.
 - [ ] Project: Understand REST and learn how to make RESTful APIs and make sure you read about REST from the original paper of Roy Fielding
 - [ ] Learn: Authentication/Authorization methodiolgies. There are many choices such as OAuth, Token Auth, JWT ..etc. you can choose once you understand more about authentication.
 - [ ] Learn: about Message Brokers, understand the "why?" and pick one. There are multiple options but RabbitMQ and Kafka is solid options.
 - [ ] Learn: As the application grows simple queries on your database arent going to cut it out and you will have to resort to a search engine. There are many options like Solr, ElasticSearch pick one after you learn about the topic more.
 - [ ] Learn: How to use Docker
 - [ ] Learn: Knowledge of Web Servers, There are several different options look at the differnt options understand differneces and limitations. Apache, Nginx .. etc.
 - [ ] Learn: how to use Web Sockets.
 - [ ] Project: Make sometinhg using web sockets.
 - [ ] Learn: GraphQL, this is not required and optional feel free to have a loot and what it is all about and why they are calling it the new REST
 - [ ] Learn: Again option, look into Graph Databases, at least you can have a little udnerstanding of what they are.
 - [ ] We have a lot more stuff like Profiling, Static Analysis, DDD SOAP, etc. Go on your journey now!
 - [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH DATABASE HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#databases)
 - [ ] Project: Once you are done doing all of the above with django create your own framwork and implement each box again with more advanced projects.

### DevOps

DevOps is something very complex instead of having a one strict route you cna carve your way up however it is very important to have a mental map of dev ops that consists of these. Try to understand each topic and atleast do a small lite demo of the things you like for practice.

- [ ] Finish: All of the missing part of the theory education in section 1
- [ ] Learn: Operating Systems, Either unix -> FreeBSD or Linux --> RHEL || CentOS || Ubuntu || Fedora

- [ ] Course : Go up and brush upon your algorithms with code university because operating systems and networkign rqeuires algorithms
- [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH OPERATING SYSTEMS HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#operating-systems)
- [ ] Course : GO UP AND FINISH NETWORKING HEADER ON [SECTION 1](#computer-networking)
