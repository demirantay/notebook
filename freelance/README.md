Never jump in on a project:
  - Always carefully understand the customer needs.
  - %50 percent of the time client will not know what tech they actually need rather than a buzzword
  - Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.
  - The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.
  - Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.
  - Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.
  - Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.

- Keep the Client updated:
  - Keep track of your time: Keep track of your time, and share it regularly with your clients, if you’re paid by the hour.
  - Offer technical advice: If you notice clients making a wrong technical decision, be sure to point that out to them rather than letting them flounder. Debate the decision, but remember that, in the end, the client always has the final word.
  - Ask questions: Don’t be afraid to ask questions; this can save you and your clients much headache down the road. In case of doubt, always ask, and avoid solving ambiguities based on what you think the client wants
  
- Do not sign an NDA (non discoluser agreement) if they do not show you the details of the project since it may challenge your future self work.

While signing a contract look out for:
  - Read the contract carefully.
  - Read it carefully again, and then again!
  - Don’t hesitate to contact an experienced attorney to review the contract for you, especially if anything is confusing, unclear or worrisome. True, it’s expensive to get legal advice, but the cost is a small fraction of what the advice could save you in the end.
  - Don’t hesitate to propose changes to the contract if you notice any errors, ambiguities or unfavorable terms.
  - If the client refuses to make the changes you require, step back and go look for other projects.
